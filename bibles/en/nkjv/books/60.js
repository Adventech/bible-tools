			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>that the genuineness of your faith, <i>being</i> much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ, ",

			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>because<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;All flesh</span> <i>is</i> <span class=\"oblique\">as grass,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And all the glory of man</span> <span class=\"oblique\">as the flower of the grass.</span><span class=\"oblique\">The grass withers,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And its flower falls away,</span>",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>and<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;A stone of stumbling</span><span class=\"oblique\">And a rock of offense.&#x201D;</span>They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed.",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by <i>your</i> good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord&#x2019;s sake, whether to the king as supreme, ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and <i>for the</i> praise of those who do good. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men&#x2014; ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Honor all <i>people.</i> Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>For this <i>is</i> commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>For what credit <i>is it</i> if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this <i>is</i> commendable before God. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Who committed no sin,</span><span class=\"oblique\">Nor was deceit found in His mouth&#x201D;</span>; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed <i>Himself</i> to Him who judges righteously; ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness&#x2014;by whose stripes you were healed. ",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;He who would love life</span><span class=\"oblique\">And see good days,</span><span class=\"oblique\">Let him refrain his tongue from evil,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And his lips from speaking deceit.</span>",

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And who <i>is</i> he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But even if you should suffer for righteousness&#x2019; sake, <i>you are</i> blessed. <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always <i>be</i> ready to <i>give</i> a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For <i>it is</i> better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison, ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while <i>the</i> ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>There is also an antitype which now saves us&#x2014;baptism (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>that he no longer should live the rest of <i>his</i> time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>For we <i>have spent</i> enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles&#x2014;when we walked in lewdness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>In regard to these, they think it strange that you do not run with <i>them</i> in the same flood of dissipation, speaking evil of <i>you.</i> ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And above all things have fervent love for one another, for <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;love will cover a multitude of sins.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup><i>Be</i> hospitable to one another without grumbling. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>If anyone speaks, <i>let him speak</i> as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, <i>let him do it</i> as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ&#x2019;s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed <i>are you,</i> for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people&#x2019;s matters. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Yet if <i>anyone suffers</i> as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For the time <i>has come</i> for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if <i>it begins</i> with us first, what will <i>be</i> the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Now<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;If the righteous one is scarcely saved,</span><span class=\"oblique\">Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?&#x201D;</span>",
