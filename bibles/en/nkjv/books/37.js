			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Thus speaks the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of hosts, saying: &#x2018;This people says, &#x201C;The time has not come, the time that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2019;s house should be built.&#x201D;&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then the word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> came by Haggai the prophet, saying, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;<i>Is it</i> time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, and this temple <i>to lie</i> in ruins?&#x201D; ",

Why?&#x201D; says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of hosts. &#x201C;Because of My house that <i>is in</i> ruins, while every one of you runs to his own house. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the heavens above you withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For I called for a drought on the land and the mountains, on the grain and the new wine and the oil, on whatever the ground brings forth, on men and livestock, and on all the labor of <i>your</i> hands.&#x201D;",
