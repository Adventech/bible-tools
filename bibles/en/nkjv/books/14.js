			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers&#x2019; <i>houses.</i> ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon; for the tabernacle of meeting with God was there, which Moses the servant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had made in the wilderness. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to <i>the place</i> David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Now the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>; Solomon and the assembly sought Him <i>there.</i> ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, which <i>was</i> at the tabernacle of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>On that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, &#x201C;Ask! What shall I give you?&#x201D;",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And Solomon said to God: &#x201C;You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me king in his place. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Now, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God, let Your promise to David my father be established, for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then God said to Solomon: &#x201C;Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life&#x2014;but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king&#x2014; ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>wisdom and knowledge <i>are</i> granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings have had who <i>were</i> before you, nor shall any after you have the like.&#x201D;",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon, from before the tabernacle of meeting, and reigned over Israel. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which <i>are</i> in the lowland. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king&#x2019;s merchants bought them in Keveh at the <i>current</i> price. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty; thus, through their agents, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>Then Solomon determined to build a temple for the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and a royal house for himself. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Solomon selected seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry <i>stone</i> in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then Solomon sent to Hiram king of Tyre, saying:As you have dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in, <i>so deal with me.</i> ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Behold, I am building a temple for the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> my God, to dedicate <i>it</i> to Him, to burn before Him sweet incense, for the continual showbread, for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the New Moons, and on the set feasts of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> our God.

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and indeed my servants <i>will be</i> with your servants, ",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then Hiram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon:Because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> loves His people, He has made you king over them.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Hiram also said:Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, for He has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, who will build a temple for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and a royal house for himself!",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram my master <i>craftsman</i>",

			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And we will cut wood from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then Solomon numbered all the aliens who <i>were</i> in the land of Israel, after the census in which David his father had numbered them; and there were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And he made seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens, eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>Now Solomon began to build the house of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where <i>the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span></i> had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And the vestibule that <i>was</i> in front <i>of the sanctuary</i> was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the height <i>was</i> one hundred and twenty. He overlaid the inside with pure gold. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>The larger room he paneled with cypress which he overlaid with fine gold, and he carved palm trees and chainwork on it. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And he decorated the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold <i>was</i> gold from Parvaim. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>He also overlaid the house&#x2014;the beams and doorposts, its walls and doors&#x2014;with gold; and he carved cherubim on the walls.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length was according to the width of the house, twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits. He overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>The weight of the nails <i>was</i> fifty shekels of gold; and he overlaid the upper area with gold. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim, fashioned by carving, and overlaid them with gold. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>The wings of the cherubim <i>were</i> twenty cubits in <i>overall</i> length: one wing <i>of the one cherub was</i> five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing <i>was</i> five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub; ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup><i>one</i> wing of the other cherub <i>was</i> five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing <i>also was</i> five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub. ",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And he made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and wove cherubim into it.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Also he made in front of the temple two pillars thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that <i>was</i> on the top of each of <i>them</i> was five cubits. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>He made wreaths of chainwork, as in the inner sanctuary, and put <i>them</i> on top of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put <i>them</i> on the wreaths of chainwork. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz."

		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Then he made the Sea of cast <i>bronze,</i> ten cubits from one brim to the other; <i>it was</i> completely round. Its height <i>was</i> five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And under it <i>was</i> the likeness of oxen encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen <i>were</i> cast in two rows, when it was cast. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea <i>was set</i> upon them, and all their back parts <i>pointed</i> inward. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>It <i>was</i> a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, <i>like</i> a lily blossom. It contained three thousand baths.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>He also made ten lavers, and put five on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they would wash in them, but the Sea <i>was</i> for the priests to wash in. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design, and set <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>He also made ten tables, and placed <i>them</i> in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>He set the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God: ",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>he also made carts and the lavers on the carts; ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>one Sea and twelve oxen under it; ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>also the pots, the shovels, the forks&#x2014;and all their articles Huram his master <i>craftsman</i> made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between Succoth and Zeredah. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And Solomon had all these articles made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God: the altar of gold and the tables on which <i>was</i> the showbread; ",

			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold. As for the entry of the sanctuary, its inner doors to the Most Holy <i>Place,</i> and the doors of the main hall of the temple, <i>were</i> gold."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5&#xA0;</span>So all the work that Solomon had done for the house of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated: the silver and the gold and all the furnishings.

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> up from the City of David, which <i>is</i> Zion.

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with the king at the feast, which <i>was</i> in the seventh month. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>So all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then they brought up the ark, the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that <i>were</i> in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites brought them up. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the Most Holy <i>Place,</i> under the wings of the cherubim. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>For the cherubim spread <i>their</i> wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>The poles extended so that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen from <i>the holy place,</i> in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day. ",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass when the priests came out of the <i>Most</i> Holy <i>Place</i> (for all the priests who <i>were</i> present had sanctified themselves, without keeping to their divisions), ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>and the Levites <i>who were</i> the singers, all those of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, stood at the east end of the altar, clothed in white linen, having cymbals, stringed instruments and harps, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets&#x2014; ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>indeed it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers <i>were</i> as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, <i>saying:</i><i>&#x201C;For He is</i> good,For His mercy <i>endures</i> forever,&#x201D;that the house, the house of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, was filled with a cloud, ",
