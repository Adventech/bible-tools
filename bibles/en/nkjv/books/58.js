			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Today, if you will hear His voice,</span>",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">Therefore I was angry with that generation,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And said, &#x2018;They always go astray in</span> <i>their</i> <span class=\"oblique\">heart,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And they have not known My ways.&#x2019;</span>",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">So I swore in My wrath,</span><span class=\"oblique\">&#x2018;They shall not enter My rest.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span>",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; ",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>while it is said:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Today, if you will hear His voice,</span><span class=\"oblique\">Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.&#x201D;</span>",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, <i>was it</i> not all who came out of Egypt, <i>led</i> by Moses? ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Now with whom was He angry forty years? <i>Was it</i> not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness? ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey? ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard <i>it.</i> ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;So I swore in My wrath,</span><span class=\"oblique\">&#x2018;They shall not enter My rest,&#x2019;&#x201D;</span>although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh <i>day</i> in this way: <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;And God rested on the seventh day from all His works&#x201D;</span>;  ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>and again in this <i>place:</i> <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;They shall not enter My rest.&#x201D;</span>",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Since therefore it remains that some <i>must</i> enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>again He designates a certain day, saying in David, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Today,&#x201D;</span> after such a long time, as it has been said:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Today, if you will hear His voice,</span><span class=\"oblique\">Do not harden your hearts.&#x201D;</span>",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God <i>did</i> from His.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For the word of God <i>is</i> living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things <i>are</i> naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we <i>must give</i> account.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5&#xA0;</span>For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer <i>sacrifices</i> for sins. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron <i>was.</i>",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but <i>it was</i> He who said to Him:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;You are My Son,</span><span class=\"oblique\">Today I have begotten You.&#x201D;</span>",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>As <i>He</i> also <i>says</i> in another <i>place:</i><span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;You</span> <i>are</i> <span class=\"oblique\">a priest forever</span><span class=\"oblique\">According to the order of Melchizedek&#x201D;</span>;",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear, ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>though He was a Son, <i>yet</i> He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>called by God as High Priest <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;according to the order of Melchizedek,&#x201D;</span> ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>of whom we have much to say, and hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need <i>someone</i> to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For everyone who partakes <i>only</i> of milk <i>is</i> unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, <i>that is,</i> those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6&#xA0;</span>Therefore, leaving the discussion of the elementary <i>principles</i> of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And this we will do if God permits.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>For <i>it is</i> impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put <i>Him</i> to an open shame.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God; ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>but if it bears thorns and briers, <i>it is</i> rejected and near to being cursed, whose end <i>is</i> to be burned.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, yes, things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this manner. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For God <i>is</i> not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, <i>in that</i> you have ministered to the saints, and do minister. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself, ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>saying, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation <i>is</i> for them an end of all dispute. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Thus God, determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed <i>it</i> by an oath, ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>that by two immutable things, in which it <i>is</i> impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before <i>us.</i>",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>This <i>hope</i> we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the <i>Presence</i> behind the veil, ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>where the forerunner has entered for us, <i>even</i> Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7&#xA0;</span>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated &#x201C;king of righteousness,&#x201D; and then also king of Salem, meaning &#x201C;king of peace,&#x201D; ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Now consider how great this man <i>was,</i> to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham; ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better. ",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak, ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need <i>was there</i> that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron? ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law. ",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>For <i>it is</i> evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. ",
