			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>To Titus, a true son in <i>our</i> common faith:Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you&#x2014; ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>if a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of dissipation or insubordination. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, ",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself <i>His</i> own special people, zealous for good works.",

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and useless. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition, ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>knowing that such a person is warped and sinning, being self-condemned.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with haste, that they may lack nothing. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And let our <i>people</i> also learn to maintain good works, to <i>meet</i> urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful.",
