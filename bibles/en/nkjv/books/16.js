			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And they said to me, &#x201C;The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province <i>are</i> there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem <i>is</i> also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <i>for many</i> days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And I said: &#x201C;I pray, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God of heaven, O great and awesome God, <i>You</i> who keep <i>Your</i> covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments, ",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, &#x2018;<i>If</i> you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations; ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>but <i>if</i> you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, <i>yet</i> I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name.&#x2019; ",

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the king said to me, &#x201C;Why <i>is</i> your face sad, since you <i>are</i> not sick? This <i>is</i> nothing but sorrow of heart.&#x201D;So I became dreadfully afraid, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>and said to the king, &#x201C;May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers&#x2019; tombs, <i>lies</i> waste, and its gates are burned with fire?&#x201D;",

			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), &#x201C;How long will your journey be? And when will you return?&#x201D; So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.",

			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So I went up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then I said to them, &#x201C;You see the distress that we <i>are</i> in, how Jerusalem <i>lies</i> waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.&#x201D; ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king&#x2019;s words that he had spoken to me.So they said, &#x201C;Let us rise up and build.&#x201D; Then they set their hands to <i>this</i> good <i>work.</i>",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard <i>of it,</i> they laughed at us and despised us, and said, &#x201C;What <i>is</i> this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?&#x201D;",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>So I answered them, and said to them, &#x201C;The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.&#x201D;"

		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>But it so happened, when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, that he was furious and very indignant, and mocked the Jews. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, &#x201C;What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish&#x2014;<i>stones</i> that are burned?&#x201D;",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Now Tobiah the Ammonite <i>was</i> beside him, and he said, &#x201C;Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up <i>on it,</i> he will break down their stone wall.&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach on their own heads, and give them as plunder to a land of captivity! ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked <i>You</i> to anger before the builders.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its <i>height,</i> for the people had a mind to work.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the gaps were beginning to be closed, that they became very angry, ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>and all of them conspired together to come <i>and</i> attack Jerusalem and create confusion. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Then Judah said, &#x201C;The strength of the laborers is failing, and <i>there is</i> so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And our adversaries said, &#x201C;They will neither know nor see anything, till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, &#x201C;From whatever place you turn, <i>they will be</i> upon us.&#x201D;",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I positioned <i>men</i> behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, &#x201C;Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and <i>that</i> God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>So it was, from that time on, <i>that</i> half of my servants worked at construction, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and <i>wore</i> armor; and the leaders <i>were</i> behind all the house of Judah. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet <i>was</i> beside me.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, &#x201C;The work <i>is</i> great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>So we labored in the work, and half of <i>the men</i> held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>At the same time I also said to the people, &#x201C;Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day.&#x201D; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, <i>except</i> that everyone took them off for washing."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5&#xA0;</span>And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their Jewish brethren. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>For there were those who said, &#x201C;We, our sons, and our daughters <i>are</i> many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.&#x201D;",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>There were also <i>some</i> who said, &#x201C;We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>There were also those who said, &#x201C;We have borrowed money for the king&#x2019;s tax <i>on</i> our lands and vineyards. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Yet now our flesh <i>is</i> as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and <i>some</i> of our daughters have been brought into slavery. <i>It is</i> not in our power <i>to redeem them,</i> for other men have our lands and vineyards.&#x201D;",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, &#x201C;Each of you is exacting usury from his brother.&#x201D; So I called a great assembly against them. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And I said to them, &#x201C;According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?&#x201D;Then they were silenced and found nothing <i>to say.</i> ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Then I said, &#x201C;What you are doing <i>is</i> not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>I also, <i>with</i> my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury! ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>So they said, &#x201C;We will restore <i>it,</i> and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say.&#x201D;Then I called the priests, and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said, &#x201C;So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.&#x201D;And all the assembly said, &#x201C;Amen!&#x201D; and praised the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. Then the people did according to this promise.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor&#x2019;s provisions. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But the former governors who <i>were</i> before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants <i>were</i> gathered there for the work.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>And at my table <i>were</i> one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Now <i>that</i> which was prepared daily <i>was</i> one ox <i>and</i> six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor&#x2019;s provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Remember me, my God, for good, <i>according to</i> all that I have done for this people."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6&#xA0;</span>Now it happened when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and <i>that</i> there were no breaks left in it (though at that time I had not hung the doors in the gates), ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, &#x201C;Come, let us meet together among the villages in the plain of Ono.&#x201D; But they thought to do me harm.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>So I sent messengers to them, saying, &#x201C;I <i>am</i> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>In it <i>was</i> written:It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, <i>that</i> you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, &#x201C;<i>There is</i> a king in Judah!&#x201D; Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Then I sent to him, saying, &#x201C;No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>For they all <i>were trying to</i> make us afraid, saying, &#x201C;Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done.&#x201D;Now therefore, <i>O God,</i> strengthen my hands.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who <i>was</i> a secret informer; and he said, &#x201C;Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And I said, &#x201C;Should such a man as I flee? And who <i>is there</i> such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!&#x201D; ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced <i>this</i> prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For this reason he <i>was</i> hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so <i>that</i> they might have <i>cause</i> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth <i>day</i> of Elul, in fifty-two days. ",
