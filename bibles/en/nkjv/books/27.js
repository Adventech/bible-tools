			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1&#xA0;</span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the articles of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the articles into the treasure house of his god.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then the king instructed Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring some of the children of Israel and some of the king&#x2019;s descendants and some of the nobles, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>young men in whom <i>there was</i> no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who <i>had</i> ability to serve in the king&#x2019;s palace, and whom they might teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king&#x2019;s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and three years of training for them, so that at the end of <i>that time</i> they might serve before the king. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names: he gave Daniel <i>the name</i> Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king&#x2019;s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Now God had brought Daniel into the favor and goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, &#x201C;I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men who <i>are</i> your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the young men who eat the portion of the king&#x2019;s delicacies; and as you see fit, <i>so</i> deal with your servants.&#x201D; ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>So he consented with them in this matter, and tested them ten days.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king&#x2019;s delicacies. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Thus the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Now at the end of the days, when the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Then the king interviewed them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore they served before the king. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding about which the king examined them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers who <i>were</i> in all his realm. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was <i>so</i> troubled that his sleep left him. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And the king said to them, &#x201C;I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, &#x201C;O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.&#x201D;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, &#x201C;My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.&#x201D;",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>They answered again and said, &#x201C;Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.&#x201D;",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said, &#x201C;I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm: ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>if you do not make known the dream to me, <i>there is only</i> one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, &#x201C;There is not a man on earth who can tell the king&#x2019;s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has <i>ever</i> asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup><i>It is</i> a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command to destroy all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise <i>men;</i> and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill <i>them.</i>",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the king&#x2019;s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon; ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>he answered and said to Arioch the king&#x2019;s captain, &#x201C;Why is the decree from the king so urgent?&#x201D; Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. So Daniel blessed the God of heaven.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Daniel answered and said:&#x201C;Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,For wisdom and might are His.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And He changes the times and the seasons;He removes kings and raises up kings;He gives wisdom to the wiseAnd knowledge to those who have understanding.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>He reveals deep and secret things;He knows what <i>is</i> in the darkness,And light dwells with Him.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I thank You and praise You,O God of my fathers;You have given me wisdom and might,And have now made known to me what we asked of You,For You have made known to us the king&#x2019;s demand.&#x201D;",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: &#x201C;Do not destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon; take me before the king, and I will tell the king the interpretation.&#x201D;",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, &#x201C;I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.&#x201D;",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, &#x201C;Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?&#x201D;",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, &#x201C;The secret which the king has demanded, the wise <i>men,</i> the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king. ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, were these: ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>As for you, O king, thoughts came <i>to</i> your <i>mind while</i> on your bed, <i>about</i> what would come to pass after this; and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for <i>our</i> sakes who make known the interpretation to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor <i>was</i> excellent, stood before you; and its form <i>was</i> awesome. ",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>This image&#x2019;s head <i>was</i> of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. ",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. ",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;This <i>is</i> the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>You, O king, <i>are</i> a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; ",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given <i>them</i> into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all&#x2014;you <i>are</i> this head of gold. ",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. ",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40&#xA0;</sup>And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, <i>that kingdom</i> will break in pieces and crush all the others. ",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41&#xA0;</sup>Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter&#x2019;s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. ",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42&#xA0;</sup>And <i>as</i> the toes of the feet <i>were</i> partly of iron and partly of clay, <i>so</i> the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. ",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43&#xA0;</sup>As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. ",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. ",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold&#x2014;the great God has made known to the king what will come to pass after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation is sure.&#x201D;",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46&#xA0;</sup>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, prostrate before Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him. ",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47&#xA0;</sup>The king answered Daniel, and said, &#x201C;Truly your God <i>is</i> the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.&#x201D; ",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48&#xA0;</sup>Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts; and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief administrator over all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. ",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49&#xA0;</sup>Also Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel <i>sat</i> in the gate of the king."

		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height <i>was</i> sixty cubits <i>and</i> its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And King Nebuchadnezzar sent <i>word</i> to gather together the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>So the satraps, the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered together for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then a herald cried aloud: &#x201C;To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup><i>that</i> at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, <i>and</i> psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.&#x201D;",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, <i>and</i> lyre, in symphony with all kinds of music, all the people, nations, and languages fell down <i>and</i> worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, &#x201C;O king, live forever! ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>You, O king, have made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, <i>and</i> psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the gold image; ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not paid due regard to you. They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image which you have set up.&#x201D;",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury, gave the command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. So they brought these men before the king. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them, &#x201C;<i>Is it</i> true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, <i>that</i> you do not serve my gods or worship the gold image which I have set up? ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, <i>and</i> psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music, and you fall down and worship the image which I have made, <i>good!</i> But if you do not worship, you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who <i>is</i> the god who will deliver you from my hands?&#x201D;",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, &#x201C;O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>If that <i>is the case,</i> our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver <i>us</i> from your hand, O king. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.&#x201D;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who <i>were</i> in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, <i>and</i> cast <i>them</i> into the burning fiery furnace. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, their turbans, and their <i>other</i> garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, because the king&#x2019;s command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; and he rose in haste <i>and</i> spoke, saying to his counselors, &#x201C;Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?&#x201D;They answered and said to the king, &#x201C;True, O king.&#x201D;",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Look!&#x201D; he answered, &#x201C;I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.&#x201D;",

			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>And the satraps, administrators, governors, and the king&#x2019;s counselors gathered together, and they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power; the hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments affected, and the smell of fire was not on them.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, &#x201C;Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have frustrated the king&#x2019;s word, and yielded their bodies, that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God!
