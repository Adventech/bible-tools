			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1&#xA0;</span>Now King David was old, advanced in years; and they put covers on him, but he could not get warm. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Therefore his servants said to him, &#x201C;Let a young woman, a virgin, be sought for our lord the king, and let her stand before the king, and let her care for him; and let her lie in your bosom, that our lord the king may be warm.&#x201D; ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>So they sought for a lovely young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>The young woman <i>was</i> very lovely; and she cared for the king, and served him; but the king did not know her.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, &#x201C;I will be king&#x201D;; and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>(And his father had not rebuked him at any time by saying, &#x201C;Why have you done so?&#x201D; He <i>was</i> also very good-looking. <i>His mother</i> had borne him after Absalom.) ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Then he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they followed and helped Adonijah. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who <i>belonged</i> to David were not with Adonijah.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which <i>is</i> by En Rogel; he also invited all his brothers, the king&#x2019;s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king&#x2019;s servants. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon his brother.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, &#x201C;Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know <i>it?</i> ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Come, please, let me now give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Go immediately to King David and say to him, &#x2018;Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your maidservant, saying, &#x201C;Assuredly your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne&#x201C;? Why then has Adonijah become king?&#x2019; ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then, while you are still talking there with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So Bathsheba went into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.) ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. Then the king said, &#x201C;What is your wish?&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then she said to him, &#x201C;My lord, you swore by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God to your maidservant, <i>saying,</i> &#x2018;Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.&#x2019; ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>So now, look! Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know about <i>it.</i> ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>He has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel <i>are</i> on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.&#x201D;",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>And just then, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So they told the king, saying, &#x201C;Here is Nathan the prophet.&#x201D; And when he came in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And Nathan said, &#x201C;My lord, O king, have you said, &#x2018;Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne&#x2019;? ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king&#x2019;s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and look! They are eating and drinking before him; and they say, &#x2018;<i>Long</i> live King Adonijah!&#x2019; ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>But he has not invited me&#x2014;me your servant&#x2014;nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not told your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?&#x201D;",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Then King David answered and said, &#x201C;Call Bathsheba to me.&#x201D; So she came into the king&#x2019;s presence and stood before the king. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>And the king took an oath and said, &#x201C;<i>As</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress, ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>just as I swore to you by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, saying, &#x2018;Assuredly Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,&#x2019; so I certainly will do this day.&#x201D;",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>Then Bathsheba bowed with <i>her</i> face to the earth, and paid homage to the king, and said, &#x201C;Let my lord King David live forever!&#x201D;",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>And King David said, &#x201C;Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.&#x201D; So they came before the king. ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>The king also said to them, &#x201C;Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon. ",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel; and blow the horn, and say, &#x2018;<i>Long</i> live King Solomon!&#x2019; ",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.&#x201D;",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, &#x201C;Amen! May the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God of my lord the king say so <i>too.</i> ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>As the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has been with my lord the king, even so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.&#x201D;",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David&#x2019;s mule, and took him to Gihon. ",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew the horn, and all the people said, <i>&#x201C;Long</i> live King Solomon!&#x201D; ",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40&#xA0;</sup>And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth <i>seemed to</i> split with their sound.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41&#xA0;</sup>Now Adonijah and all the guests who <i>were</i> with him heard <i>it</i> as they finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said, &#x201C;Why <i>is</i> the city in such a noisy uproar?&#x201D; ",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42&#xA0;</sup>While he was still speaking, there came Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest. And Adonijah said to him, &#x201C;Come in, for you <i>are</i> a prominent man, and bring good news.&#x201D;",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43&#xA0;</sup>Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, &#x201C;No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. ",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king&#x2019;s mule. ",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This <i>is</i> the noise that you have heard. ",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46&#xA0;</sup>Also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom. ",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47&#xA0;</sup>And moreover the king&#x2019;s servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, &#x2018;May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.&#x2019; Then the king bowed himself on the bed. ",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48&#xA0;</sup>Also the king said thus, &#x2018;Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, who has given <i>one</i> to sit on my throne this day, while my eyes see <i>it!</i>&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49&#xA0;</sup>So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and each one went his way.",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50&#xA0;</sup>Now Adonijah was afraid of Solomon; so he arose, and went and took hold of the horns of the altar. ",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51&#xA0;</sup>And it was told Solomon, saying, &#x201C;Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for look, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, &#x2018;Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52&#xA0;</sup>Then Solomon said, &#x201C;If he proves himself a worthy man, not one hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.&#x201D; ",
			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53&#xA0;</sup>So King Solomon sent them to bring him down from the altar. And he came and fell down before King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, &#x201C;Go to your house.&#x201D;"
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>Now the days of David drew near that he should die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying: ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I go the way of all the earth; be strong, therefore, and prove yourself a man. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And keep the charge of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God: to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn; ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> may fulfill His word which He spoke concerning me, saying, &#x2018;If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.&#x2019;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, <i>and</i> what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed. And he shed the blood of war in peacetime, and put the blood of war on his belt that <i>was</i> around his waist, and on his sandals that <i>were</i> on his feet. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Therefore do according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to the grave in peace.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And see, <i>you have</i> with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a malicious curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, saying, &#x2018;I will not put you to death with the sword.&#x2019; ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless, for you <i>are</i> a wise man and know what you ought to do to him; but bring his gray hair down to the grave with blood.&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>So David rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>The period that David reigned over Israel <i>was</i> forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was firmly established.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. So she said, &#x201C;Do you come peaceably?&#x201D;And he said, &#x201C;Peaceably.&#x201D; ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Moreover he said, &#x201C;I have something <i>to say</i> to you.&#x201D;And she said, &#x201C;Say it.&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Then he said, &#x201C;You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their expectations on me, that I should reign. However, the kingdom has been turned over, and has become my brother&#x2019;s; for it was his from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Now I ask one petition of you; do not deny me.&#x201D;And she said to him, &#x201C;Say it.&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then he said, &#x201C;Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not refuse you, that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.&#x201D;",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>So Bathsheba said, &#x201C;Very well, I will speak for you to the king.&#x201D;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Bathsheba therefore went to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and bowed down to her, and sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king&#x2019;s mother; so she sat at his right hand. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Then she said, &#x201C;I desire one small petition of you; do not refuse me.&#x201D;And the king said to her, &#x201C;Ask it, my mother, for I will not refuse you.&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>So she said, &#x201C;Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.&#x201D;",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, &#x201C;Now why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also&#x2014;for he <i>is</i> my older brother&#x2014;for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.&#x201D; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>Then King Solomon swore by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, saying, &#x201C;May God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life! ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, <i>as</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> lives, who has confirmed me and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has established a house for me, as He promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today!&#x201D;",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he struck him down, and he died.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>And to Abiathar the priest the king said, &#x201C;Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you <i>are</i> deserving of death; but I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> before my father David, and because you were afflicted every time my father was afflicted.&#x201D; ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, that he might fulfill the word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> which He spoke concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Then news came to Joab, for Joab had defected to Adonijah, though he had not defected to Absalom. So Joab fled to the tabernacle of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and took hold of the horns of the altar. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>And King Solomon was told, &#x201C;Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>; there <i>he is,</i> by the altar.&#x201D; Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, &#x201C;Go, strike him down.&#x201D; ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>So Benaiah went to the tabernacle of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and said to him, &#x201C;Thus says the king, &#x2018;Come out!&#x2019;&#x201D;And he said, &#x201C;No, but I will die here.&#x201D; And Benaiah brought back word to the king, saying, &#x201C;Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.&#x201D;",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said to him, &#x201C;Do as he has said, and strike him down and bury him, that you may take away from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood which Joab shed. ",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will return his blood on his head, because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword&#x2014;Abner the son of Ner, the commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the commander of the army of Judah&#x2014;though my father David did not know <i>it.</i> ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever. But upon David and his descendants, upon his house and his throne, there shall be peace forever from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. ",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>Then the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, &#x201C;Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there anywhere. ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>For it shall be, on the day you go out and cross the Brook Kidron, know for certain you shall surely die; your blood shall be on your own head.&#x201D;",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>And Shimei said to the king, &#x201C;The saying <i>is</i> good. As my lord the king has said, so your servant will do.&#x201D; So Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened at the end of three years, that two slaves of Shimei ran away to Achish the son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, &#x201C;Look, your slaves <i>are</i> in Gath!&#x201D; ",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40&#xA0;</sup>So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to seek his slaves. And Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath. ",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41&#xA0;</sup>And Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come back. ",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42&#xA0;</sup>Then the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, &#x201C;Did I not make you swear by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and warn you, saying, &#x2018;Know for certain that on the day you go out and travel anywhere, you shall surely die&#x2019;? And you said to me, &#x2018;The word I have heard <i>is</i> good.&#x2019; ",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43&#xA0;</sup>Why then have you not kept the oath of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and the commandment that I gave you?&#x201D; ",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>The king said moreover to Shimei, &#x201C;You know, as your heart acknowledges, all the wickedness that you did to my father David; therefore the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will return your wickedness on your own head. ",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>But King Solomon <i>shall be</i> blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> forever.&#x201D;",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46&#xA0;</sup>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and struck him down, and he died. Thus the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."

",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Meanwhile the people sacrificed at the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> until those days. ",

			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, &#x201C;Which way did the spirit from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> go from me to speak to you?&#x201D;",

			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &#x201C;I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes.&#x201D; So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.",

			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>And it happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it <i>was</i> not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. ",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>Now a <i>certain</i> man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, &#x201C;Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.&#x201D;",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>The battle increased that day; and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot. ",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>Then, as the sun was going down, a shout went throughout the army, saying, &#x201C;Every man to his city, and every man to his own country!&#x201D;",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria. ",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>Then <i>someone</i> washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood while the harlots bathed, according to the word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> which He had spoken.",

Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, <i>for</i> the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places. ",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? ",

			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50&#xA0;</sup>And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place.",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51&#xA0;</sup>Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. ",

			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53&#xA0;</sup>for he served Baal and worshiped him, and provoked the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done."
