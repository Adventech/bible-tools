			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup><i>and</i> declared <i>to be</i> the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Through Him we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for His name, ",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called <i>to be</i> saints:Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers, ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>making request if, by some means, now at last I may find a way in the will of God to come to you. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established&#x2014; ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>that is, that I may be encouraged together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Now I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but was hindered until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So, as much as is in me, <i>I am</i> ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. ",

			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown <i>it</i> to them. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>For since the creation of the world His invisible <i>attributes</i> are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even</i> His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>because, although they knew God, they did not glorify <i>Him</i> as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Professing to be wise, they became fools, ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man&#x2014;and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; <i>they are</i> whisperers, ",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For there is no partiality with God.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law ",

			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Indeed you are called a Jew, and rest on the law, and make your boast in God, ",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and truth in the law. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal? ",

			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>You who make your boast in the law, do you dishonor God through breaking the law? ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>For <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,&#x201D;</span> as it is written.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>For circumcision is indeed profitable if you keep the law; but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision? ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>And will not the physically uncircumcised, if he fulfills the law, judge you who, <i>even</i> with <i>your</i> written <i>code</i> and circumcision, <i>are</i> a transgressor of the law? ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>For he is not a Jew who <i>is one</i> outwardly, nor <i>is</i> circumcision that which <i>is</i> outward in the flesh; ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>but <i>he is</i> a Jew who <i>is one</i> inwardly; and circumcision <i>is that</i> of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise <i>is</i> not from men but from God."

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Whose mouth <i>is</i> full of cursing and bitterness.&#x201D;</span>",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Their feet <i>are</i> swift to shed blood;</span>",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">Destruction and misery</span> <i>are</i> <span class=\"oblique\">in their ways;</span>",

			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&#x201D;</span>",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law <i>is</i> the knowledge of sin.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>whom God set forth <i>as</i> a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, ",

		},

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had while still</i> uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also, ",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>For if those who are of the law <i>are</i> heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law <i>there is</i> no transgression.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Therefore <i>it is</i> of faith that <i>it might be</i> according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>(as it is written, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;I have made you a father of many nations&#x201D;</span>) in the presence of Him whom he believed&#x2014;God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did; ",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah&#x2019;s womb. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>And therefore <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;</span>",

			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, ",
