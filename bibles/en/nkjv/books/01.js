			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And God saw the light, that <i>it was</i> good; and God divided the light from the darkness. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Then God said, &#x201C;Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.&#x201D; ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which <i>were</i> under the firmament from the waters which <i>were</i> above the firmament; and it was so. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Then God said, &#x201C;Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry <i>land</i> appear&#x201D;; and it was so. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And God called the dry <i>land</i> Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that <i>it was</i> good.",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And the earth brought forth grass, the herb <i>that</i> yields seed according to its kind, and the tree <i>that</i> yields fruit, whose seed <i>is</i> in itself according to its kind. And God saw that <i>it was</i> good. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>So the evening and the morning were the third day.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then God said, &#x201C;Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years; ",

			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. <i>He made</i> the stars also. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth, ",

			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that <i>it was</i> good. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>And God blessed them, saying, &#x201C;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.&#x201D; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So the evening and the morning were the fifth day.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Then God said, &#x201C;Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, <i>each</i> according to its kind&#x201D;; and it was so. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that <i>it was</i> good.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Then God said, &#x201C;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&#x201D; ",

			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>And God said, &#x201C;See, I have given you every herb <i>that</i> yields seed which <i>is</i> on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which <i>there is</i> life, <i>I have given</i> every green herb for food&#x201D;; and it was so. ",

			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. ",
