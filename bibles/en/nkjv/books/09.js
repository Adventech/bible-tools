			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1&#xA0;</span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the mountains of Ephraim, and his name <i>was</i> Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And he had two wives: the name of one <i>was</i> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>This man went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of hosts in Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, <i>were</i> there. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, although the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had closed her womb. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And her rival also provoked her severely, to make her miserable, because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had closed her womb. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Then Elkanah her husband said to her, &#x201C;Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? <i>Am</i> I not better to you than ten sons?&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So Hannah arose after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the tabernacle of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And she <i>was</i> in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and wept in anguish. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then she made a vow and said, &#x201C;O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And it happened, as she continued praying before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, that Eli watched her mouth. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>So Eli said to her, &#x201C;How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But Hannah answered and said, &#x201C;No, my lord, I <i>am</i> a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Do not consider your maidservant a wicked woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken until now.&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then Eli answered and said, &#x201C;Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.&#x201D;",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And she said, &#x201C;Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.&#x201D; So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer <i>sad.</i>",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> remembered her. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel, <i>saying,</i> &#x201C;Because I have asked for him from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice and his vow. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, &#x201C;<i>Not</i> until the child is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and remain there forever.&#x201D;",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So Elkanah her husband said to her, &#x201C;Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only let the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> establish His word.&#x201D; Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> in Shiloh. And the child <i>was</i> young. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Then they slaughtered a bull, and brought the child to Eli. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>And she said, &#x201C;O my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I <i>am</i> the woman who stood by you here, praying to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>For this child I prayed, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has granted me my petition which I asked of Him. ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I also have lent him to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D; So they worshiped the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> there."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>And Hannah prayed and said:&#x201C;My heart rejoices in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>;My horn is exalted in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.I smile at my enemies,Because I rejoice in Your salvation.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;No one is holy like the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>,For <i>there is</i> none besides You,Nor <i>is there</i> any rock like our God.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Talk no more so very proudly;Let no arrogance come from your mouth,For the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> <i>is</i> the God of knowledge;And by Him actions are weighed.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;The bows of the mighty men <i>are</i> broken,And those who stumbled are girded with strength.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup><i>Those who were</i> full have hired themselves out for bread,And the hungry have ceased <i>to hunger.</i>Even the barren has borne seven,And she who has many children has become feeble.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> kills and makes alive;He brings down to the grave and brings up.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> makes poor and makes rich;He brings low and lifts up.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>He raises the poor from the dust<i>And</i> lifts the beggar from the ash heap,To set <i>them</i> among princesAnd make them inherit the throne of glory.&#x201C;For the pillars of the earth <i>are</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2019;s,And He has set the world upon them.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>He will guard the feet of His saints,But the wicked shall be silent in darkness.&#x201C;For by strength no man shall prevail.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>The adversaries of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> shall be broken in pieces;From heaven He will thunder against them.The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will judge the ends of the earth.&#x201C;He will give strength to His king,And exalt the horn of His anointed.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then Elkanah went to his house at Ramah. But the child ministered to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> before Eli the priest.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Now the sons of Eli <i>were</i> corrupt; they did not know the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And the priests&#x2019; custom with the people <i>was that</i> when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest&#x2019;s servant would come with a three-pronged fleshhook in his hand while the meat was boiling. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then he would thrust <i>it</i> into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; and the priest would take for himself all that the fleshhook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Also, before they burned the fat, the priest&#x2019;s servant would come and say to the man who sacrificed, &#x201C;Give meat for roasting to the priest, for he will not take boiled meat from you, but raw.&#x201D;",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And <i>if</i> the man said to him, &#x201C;They should really burn the fat first; <i>then</i> you may take <i>as much</i> as your heart desires,&#x201D; he would then answer him, &#x201C;<i>No,</i> but you must give <i>it</i> now; and if not, I will take <i>it</i> by force.&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, for men abhorred the offering of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>But Samuel ministered before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, <i>even as</i> a child, wearing a linen ephod. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Moreover his mother used to make him a little robe, and bring <i>it</i> to him year by year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, &#x201C;The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> give you descendants from this woman for the loan that was given to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D; Then they would go to their own home.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> visited Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile the child Samuel grew before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Now Eli was very old; and he heard everything his sons did to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So he said to them, &#x201C;Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>No, my sons! For <i>it is</i> not a good report that I hear. You make the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2019;s people transgress. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>If one man sins against another, God will judge him. But if a man sins against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, who will intercede for him?&#x201D; Nevertheless they did not heed the voice of their father, because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> desired to kill them.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>And the child Samuel grew in stature, and in favor both with the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and men.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him, &#x201C;Thus says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#x2018;Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh&#x2019;s house? ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel <i>to be</i> My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod before Me? And did I not give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering which I have commanded <i>in My</i> dwelling place, and honor your sons more than Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?&#x2019; ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God of Israel says: &#x2018;I said indeed <i>that</i> your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever.&#x2019; But now the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says: &#x2018;Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed. ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>Behold, the days are coming that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father&#x2019;s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. ",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>And you will see an enemy <i>in My</i> dwelling place, <i>despite</i> all the good which God does for Israel. And there shall not be an old man in your house forever. ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>But any of your men <i>whom</i> I do not cut off from My altar shall consume your eyes and grieve your heart. And all the descendants of your house shall die in the flower of their age. ",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>Now this <i>shall be</i> a sign to you that will come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them. ",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest <i>who</i> shall do according to what <i>is</i> in My heart and in My mind. I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed forever. ",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left in your house will come <i>and</i> bow down to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and say, &#x201C;Please, put me in one of the priestly positions, that I may eat a piece of bread.&#x201D;&#x2019;&#x201D;"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>Now the boy Samuel ministered to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> before Eli.

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass at that time, while Eli <i>was</i> lying down in his place, and when his eyes had begun to grow so dim that he could not see, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>and before the lamp of God went out in the tabernacle of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> where the ark of God <i>was,</i> and while Samuel was lying down, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> called Samuel. And he answered, &#x201C;Here I am!&#x201D; ",

			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> called yet again, &#x201C;Samuel!&#x201D;So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, &#x201C;Here I am, for you called me.&#x201D; He answered, &#x201C;I did not call, my son; lie down again.&#x201D; ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>(Now Samuel did not yet know the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, nor was the word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> yet revealed to him.)",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> called Samuel again the third time.

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, &#x201C;Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He calls you, that you must say, &#x2018;Speak, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, for Your servant hears.&#x2019;&#x201D; So Samuel went and lay down in his place.",
