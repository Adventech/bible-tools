			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, &#x201C;Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&#x201D; ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority.</span> ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me</span><span class=\"woj\"> in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.&#x201D;</span>",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. ",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>who also said, &#x201C;Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This <i>same</i> Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&#x2019;s journey. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, James, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas <i>the son</i> of James. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.",

			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.&#x201D;",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>(Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;For it is written in the Book of Psalms:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x2018;Let his dwelling place be desolate,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And let no one live in it&#x2019;</span>;and,<span class=\"oblique\">&#x2018;Let</span> <span class=\"oblique\">another take his office.&#x2019;</span>",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, ",

			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. ",

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, &#x201C;Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? ",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, &#x201C;Whatever could this mean?&#x201D;",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Others mocking said, &#x201C;They are full of new wine.&#x201D;",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, &#x201C;Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words. ",

			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know&#x2014; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; ",

			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>For David says concerning Him:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x2018;I foresaw the L</span><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">ord</span><span class=\"oblique\"> always before my face,</span><span class=\"oblique\">For He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.</span>",

			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter said to them, &#x201C;Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. ",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.&#x201D;",

			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46&#xA0;</sup>So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, ",

			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Then Peter said, &#x201C;Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.&#x201D; ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And he took him by the right hand and lifted <i>him</i> up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them&#x2014;walking, leaping, and praising God. ",

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let <i>Him</i> go. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which <i>comes</i> through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And they laid hands on them, and put <i>them</i> in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>However, many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.",

			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, &#x201C;By what power or by what name have you done this?&#x201D;",

			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;What shall we do to these men? For, indeed, that a notable miracle has been done through them <i>is</i> evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny <i>it.</i> ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, that from now on they speak to no man in this name.&#x201D;",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>But Peter and John answered and said to them, &#x201C;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.&#x201D; ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done. ",

			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: &#x201C;Lord, You <i>are</i> God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them, ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>who by the mouth of Your servant David have said:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x2018;Why did the nations rage,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And the people plot vain things?</span>",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">The kings of the earth took their stand,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And the rulers were gathered together</span><span class=\"oblique\">Against the L</span><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">ord</span><span class=\"oblique\"> and against His Christ.&#x2019;</span>",

			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And this she did for many days.But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, &#x201C;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.&#x201D; And he came out that very hour. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged <i>them</i> into the marketplace to the authorities.",

			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded <i>them</i> to be beaten with rods. ",

			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&#x2019;s chains were loosed. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself. ",

			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>And he brought them out and said, &#x201C;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&#x201D;",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>So they said, &#x201C;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.&#x201D; ",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed <i>their</i> stripes. And immediately he and all his <i>family</i> were baptized. ",

			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>So the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul, saying, &#x201C;The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.&#x201D;",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>But Paul said to them, &#x201C;They have beaten us openly, uncondemned Romans, <i>and</i> have thrown <i>us</i> into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and get us out.&#x201D;",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>And the officers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans. ",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>Then they came and pleaded with them and brought <i>them</i> out, and asked <i>them</i> to depart from the city. ",

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and Silas.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>But the Jews who were not persuaded, becoming envious, took some of the evil men from the marketplace, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and attacked the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, &#x201C;These who have turned the world upside down have come here too. ",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily <i>to find out</i> whether these things were so. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go to the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the <i>Gentile</i> worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him.

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, &#x201C;May we know what this new doctrine <i>is</i> of which you speak? ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.&#x201D; ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, &#x201C;Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you: ",

			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, ",

			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, &#x2018;For we are also His offspring.&#x2019; ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man&#x2019;s devising. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.&#x201D;",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, &#x201C;We will hear you again on this <i>matter.</i>&#x201D; ",

			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>But when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of <i>the</i> Way, he adjourned the proceedings and said, &#x201C;When Lysias the commander comes down, I will make a decision on your case.&#x201D; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let <i>him</i> have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, &#x201C;Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.&#x201D; ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.",

		},
		"25": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">25&#xA0;</span>Now when Festus had come to the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they petitioned him, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem&#x2014;while <i>they</i> lay in ambush along the road to kill him. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was going <i>there</i> shortly. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Therefore,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;let those who have authority among you go down with <i>me</i> and accuse this man, to see if there is any fault in him.&#x201D;",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood about and laid many serious complaints against Paul, which they could not prove, ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>while he answered for himself, &#x201C;Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything at all.&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, &#x201C;Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>So Paul said, &#x201C;I stand at Caesar&#x2019;s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For if I am an offender, or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not object to dying; but if there is nothing in these things of which these men accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, &#x201C;You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go!&#x201D;",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>When they had been there many days, Festus laid Paul&#x2019;s case before the king, saying: &#x201C;There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix, ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed <i>me,</i> when I was in Jerusalem, asking for a judgment against him. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>To them I answered, &#x2018;It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to answer for himself concerning the charge against him.&#x2019; ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Therefore when they had come together, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation against him of such things as I supposed, ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>And because I was uncertain of such questions, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>But when Paul appealed to be reserved for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Caesar.&#x201D;",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Then Agrippa said to Festus, &#x201C;I also would like to hear the man myself.&#x201D;&#x201C;Tomorrow,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;you shall hear him.&#x201D;",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at Festus&#x2019; command Paul was brought in. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And Festus said: &#x201C;King Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole assembly of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he was not fit to live any longer. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>But when I found that he had committed nothing deserving of death, and that he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I may have something to write. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.&#x201D;"
		},
		"26": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">26&#xA0;</span>Then Agrippa said to Paul, &#x201C;You are permitted to speak for yourself.&#x201D;So Paul stretched out his hand and answered for himself: ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall answer for myself before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;My manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>They knew me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>To this <i>promise</i> our twelve tribes, earnestly serving <i>God</i> night and day, hope to attain. For this hope&#x2019;s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Why should it be thought incredible by you that God raises the dead?",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against <i>them.</i> ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled <i>them</i> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted <i>them</i> even to foreign cities.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;While thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, <span class=\"woj\">&#x2018;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? <i>It is</i> hard for you to kick against the goads.&#x2019;</span> ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So I said, &#x2018;Who are You, Lord?&#x2019; And He said, <span class=\"woj\">&#x2018;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things which I will yet reveal to you.</span> ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">I will deliver you from the <i>Jewish</i> people, as well as <i>from</i> the Gentiles, to whom I now</span><span class=\"woj\"> send you,</span> ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">to open their eyes, <i>in order</i> to turn <i>them</i> from darkness to light, and <i>from</i> the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.&#x2019;</span>",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>but declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and <i>then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill <i>me.</i> ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said would come&#x2014; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>that the Christ would suffer, that He would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the <i>Jewish</i> people and to the Gentiles.&#x201D;",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, &#x201C;Paul, you are beside yourself! Much learning is driving you mad!&#x201D;",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>But he said, &#x201C;I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and reason. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>For the king, before whom I also speak freely, knows these things; for I am convinced that none of these things escapes his attention, since this thing was not done in a corner. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do believe.&#x201D;",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Then Agrippa said to Paul, &#x201C;You almost persuade me to become a Christian.&#x201D;",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>And Paul said, &#x201C;I would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these chains.&#x201D;",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them; ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, &#x201C;This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains.&#x201D;",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>Then Agrippa said to Festus, &#x201C;This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.&#x201D;"
		},
		"27": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">27&#xA0;</span>And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to <i>one</i> named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Regiment. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>So, entering a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And the next <i>day</i> we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave <i>him</i> liberty to go to his friends and receive care. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>When we had put to sea from there, we sailed under <i>the shelter of</i> Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, <i>a city</i> of Lycia. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on board.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>When we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under <i>the shelter of</i> Crete off Salmone. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city <i>of</i> Lasea.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous because the Fast was already over, Paul advised them, ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.&#x201D; ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, <i>and</i> winter <i>there.</i>",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained <i>their</i> desire, putting out to sea, they sailed close by Crete. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But not long after, a tempestuous head wind arose, called Euroclydon. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let <i>her</i> drive. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And running under <i>the shelter of</i> an island called Clauda, we secured the skiff with difficulty. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the Syrtis <i>Sands,</i> they struck sail and so were driven. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next <i>day</i> they lightened the ship. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>On the third <i>day</i> we threw the ship&#x2019;s tackle overboard with our own hands. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on <i>us,</i> all hope that we would be saved was finally given up.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, &#x201C;Men, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this disaster and loss. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>And now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>For there stood by me this night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve, ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x2018;Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.&#x2019; ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Therefore take heart, men, for I believe God that it will be just as it was told me. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>However, we must run aground on a certain island.&#x201D;",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic <i>Sea,</i> about midnight the sailors sensed that they were drawing near some land. ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>And they took soundings and found <i>it</i> to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found <i>it</i> to be fifteen fathoms. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the skiff into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow, ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, &#x201C;Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.&#x201D; ",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>And as day was about to dawn, Paul implored <i>them</i> all to take food, saying, &#x201C;Today is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, and eaten nothing. ",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.&#x201D; ",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken <i>it</i> he began to eat. ",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>Then they were all encouraged, and also took food themselves. ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six persons on the ship. ",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>When it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship if possible. ",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40&#xA0;</sup>And they let go the anchors and left <i>them</i> in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder ropes; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore. ",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41&#xA0;</sup>But striking a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42&#xA0;</sup>And the soldiers&#x2019; plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape. ",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43&#xA0;</sup>But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from <i>their</i> purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump <i>overboard</i> first and get to land, ",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>and the rest, some on boards and some on <i>parts</i> of the ship. And so it was that they all escaped safely to land."
		},
		"28": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">28&#xA0;</span>Now when they had escaped, they then found out that the island was called Malta. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And the natives showed us unusual kindness; for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid <i>them</i> on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, &#x201C;No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.&#x201D; ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>In that region there was an estate of the leading citizen of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and entertained us courteously for three days. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>They also honored us in many ways; and when we departed, they provided such things as were necessary.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>After three months we sailed in an Alexandrian ship whose figurehead was the Twin Brothers, which had wintered at the island. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>From there we circled round and reached Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli, ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>where we found brethren, and were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Now when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>And it came to pass after three days that Paul called the leaders of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: &#x201C;Men <i>and</i> brethren, though I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>who, when they had examined me, wanted to let <i>me</i> go, because there was no cause for putting me to death. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>But when the Jews spoke against <i>it,</i> I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see <i>you</i> and speak with <i>you,</i> because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to him, &#x201C;We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.&#x201D;",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at <i>his</i> lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>So when they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had said one word: &#x201C;The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>saying,<span class=\"oblique\">&#x2018;Go to this people and say:</span><span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand;</span><span class=\"oblique\">And seeing you will see, and not perceive;</span>",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">For the hearts of this people have grown dull.</span><i>Their</i> <span class=\"oblique\">ears are hard of hearing,</span><span class=\"oblique\">And their eyes they have closed,</span><span class=\"oblique\">Lest they should see with</span> <i>their</i> <span class=\"oblique\">eyes and hear with</span> <i>their</i> <span class=\"oblique\">ears,</span><span class=\"oblique\">Lest they should understand with</span> <i>their</i> <span class=\"oblique\">hearts and turn,</span><span class=\"oblique\">So that I should heal them.&#x201D;&#x2019;</span>",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!&#x201D; ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him, ",
