			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1&#xA0;</span>Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this <i>was</i> the Ahasuerus who reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India to Ethiopia), ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which <i>was</i> in Shushan the citadel, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup><i>that</i> in the third year of his reign he made a feast for all his officials and servants&#x2014;the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of the provinces <i>being</i> before him&#x2014; ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his excellent majesty for many days, one hundred and eighty days <i>in all.</i>",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And when these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were present in Shushan the citadel, from great to small, in the court of the garden of the king&#x2019;s palace. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup><i>There were</i> white and blue linen <i>curtains</i> fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars; <i>and the</i> couches <i>were</i> of gold and silver on a <i>mosaic</i> pavement of alabaster, turquoise, and white and black marble. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And they served drinks in golden vessels, each vessel being different from the other, with royal wine in abundance, according to the generosity of the king. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household, that they should do according to each man&#x2019;s pleasure.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women <i>in</i> the royal palace which <i>belonged</i> to King Ahasuerus.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus, ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>to bring Queen Vashti before the king, <i>wearing</i> her royal crown, in order to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she <i>was</i> beautiful to behold. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king&#x2019;s command <i>brought</i> by <i>his</i> eunuchs; therefore the king was furious, and his anger burned within him.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times (for this <i>was</i> the king&#x2019;s manner toward all who knew law and justice, ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>those closest to him <i>being</i> Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who had access to the king&#x2019;s presence, <i>and</i> who ranked highest in the kingdom): ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;What <i>shall we</i> do to Queen Vashti, according to law, because she did not obey the command of King Ahasuerus <i>brought to her</i> by the eunuchs?&#x201D;",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes: &#x201C;Queen Vashti has not only wronged the king, but also all the princes, and all the people who <i>are</i> in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For the queen&#x2019;s behavior will become known to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when they report, &#x2018;King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come.&#x2019; ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>This very day the <i>noble</i> ladies of Persia and Media will say to all the king&#x2019;s officials that they have heard of the behavior of the queen. Thus <i>there will be</i> excessive contempt and wrath. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>If it pleases the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it will not be altered, that Vashti shall come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>When the king&#x2019;s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire (for it is great), all wives will honor their husbands, both great and small.&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And the reply pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Then he sent letters to all the king&#x2019;s provinces, to each province in its own script, and to every people in their own language, that each man should be master in his own house, and speak in the language of his own people."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed against her. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Then the king&#x2019;s servants who attended him said: &#x201C;Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king; ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the citadel, into the women&#x2019;s quarters, under the custody of Hegai the king&#x2019;s eunuch, custodian of the women. And let beauty preparations be given <i>them.</i> ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.&#x201D;This thing pleased the king, and he did so.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>In Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew whose name <i>was</i> Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup><i>Kish</i> had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been captured with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And <i>Mordecai</i> had brought up Hadassah, that <i>is,</i> Esther, his uncle&#x2019;s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman <i>was</i> lovely and beautiful. When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the king&#x2019;s command and decree were heard, and when many young women were gathered at Shushan the citadel, <i>under</i> the custody of Hegai, that Esther also was taken to the king&#x2019;s palace, into the care of Hegai the custodian of the women. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Now the young woman pleased him, and she obtained his favor; so he readily gave beauty preparations to her, besides her allowance. Then seven choice maidservants were provided for her from the king&#x2019;s palace, and he moved her and her maidservants to the best <i>place</i> in the house of the women.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Esther had not revealed her people or family, for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal <i>it.</i> ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And every day Mordecai paced in front of the court of the women&#x2019;s quarters, to learn of Esther&#x2019;s welfare and what was happening to her.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Each young woman&#x2019;s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months&#x2019; preparation, according to the regulations for the women, for thus were the days of their preparation apportioned: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Thus <i>prepared, each</i> young woman went to the king, and she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the women&#x2019;s quarters to the king&#x2019;s palace. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king&#x2019;s eunuch who kept the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Now when the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what Hegai the king&#x2019;s eunuch, the custodian of the women, advised. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all who saw her. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which <i>is</i> the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>The king loved Esther more than all the <i>other</i> women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Then the king made a great feast, the Feast of Esther, for all his officials and servants; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts according to the generosity of a king.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>When virgins were gathered together a second time, Mordecai sat within the king&#x2019;s gate. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup><i>Now</i> Esther had not revealed her family and her people, just as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>In those days, while Mordecai sat within the king&#x2019;s gate, two of the king&#x2019;s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, doorkeepers, became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>So the matter became known to Mordecai, who told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai&#x2019;s name. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>And when an inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed, and both were hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who <i>were</i> with him. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And all the king&#x2019;s servants who <i>were</i> within the king&#x2019;s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai would not bow or pay homage. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then the king&#x2019;s servants who <i>were</i> within the king&#x2019;s gate said to Mordecai, &#x201C;Why do you transgress the king&#x2019;s command?&#x201D; ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told <i>it</i> to Haman, to see whether Mordecai&#x2019;s words would stand; for <i>Mordecai</i> had told them that he <i>was</i> a Jew. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was filled with wrath. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who <i>were</i> throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus&#x2014;the people of Mordecai.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that <i>is,</i> the lot), before Haman to determine the day and the month, until <i>it fell on the</i> twelfth <i>month,</i> which <i>is</i> the month of Adar.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, &#x201C;There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws <i>are</i> different from all <i>other</i> people&#x2019;s, and they do not keep the king&#x2019;s laws. Therefore it <i>is</i> not fitting for the king to let them remain. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>If it pleases the king, let <i>a decree</i> be written that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work, to bring <i>it</i> into the king&#x2019;s treasuries.&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And the king said to Haman, &#x201C;The money and the people <i>are</i> given to you, to do with them as seems good to you.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Then the king&#x2019;s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and <i>a decree</i> was written according to all that Haman commanded&#x2014;to the king&#x2019;s satraps, to the governors who <i>were</i> over each province, to the officials of all people, to every province according to its script, and to every people in their language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king&#x2019;s signet ring. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king&#x2019;s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth <i>day</i> of the twelfth month, which <i>is</i> the month of Adar, and to plunder their possessions. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province, being published for all people, that they should be ready for that day. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>The couriers went out, hastened by the king&#x2019;s command; and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan the citadel. So the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was perplexed."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>When Mordecai learned all that had happened, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city. He cried out with a loud and bitter cry. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>He went as far as the front of the king&#x2019;s gate, for no one <i>might</i> enter the king&#x2019;s gate clothed with sackcloth. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And in every province where the king&#x2019;s command and decree arrived, <i>there was</i> great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>So Esther&#x2019;s maids and eunuchs came and told her, and the queen was deeply distressed. Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him, but he would not accept <i>them.</i> ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther called Hathach, <i>one</i> of the king&#x2019;s eunuchs whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this <i>was.</i> ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that <i>was</i> in front of the king&#x2019;s gate. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king&#x2019;s treasuries to destroy the Jews. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>He also gave him a copy of the written decree for their destruction, which was given at Shushan, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her, and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplication to him and plead before him for her people. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a command for Mordecai: ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;All the king&#x2019;s servants and the people of the king&#x2019;s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king, who has not been called, <i>he has</i> but one law: put <i>all</i> to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter, that he may live. Yet I myself have not been called to go in to the king these thirty days.&#x201D; ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>So they told Mordecai Esther&#x2019;s words.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And Mordecai told <i>them</i> to answer Esther: &#x201C;Do not think in your heart that you will escape in the king&#x2019;s palace any more than all the other Jews. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&#x2019;s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for <i>such</i> a time as this?&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther told <i>them</i> to reply to Mordecai: ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go to the king, which <i>is</i> against the law; and if I perish, I perish!&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5&#xA0;</span>Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on <i>her</i> royal <i>robes</i> and stood in the inner court of the king&#x2019;s palace, across from the king&#x2019;s house, while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance of the house. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, <i>that</i> she found favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that <i>was</i> in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And the king said to her, &#x201C;What do you wish, Queen Esther? What <i>is</i> your request? It shall be given to you&#x2014;up to half the kingdom!&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>So Esther answered, &#x201C;If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.&#x201D;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said, &#x201C;Bring Haman quickly, that he may do as Esther has said.&#x201D; So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, &#x201C;What <i>is</i> your petition? It shall be granted you. What <i>is</i> your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!&#x201D;",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Then Esther answered and said, &#x201C;My petition and request <i>is this:</i> ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king&#x2019;s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and called for his friends and his wife Zeresh. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then Haman told them of his great riches, the multitude of his children, everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and servants of the king.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Moreover Haman said, &#x201C;Besides, Queen Esther invited no one but me to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king&#x2019;s gate.&#x201D;",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, &#x201C;Let a gallows be made, fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it; then go merrily with the king to the banquet.&#x201D;And the thing pleased Haman; so he had the gallows made."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6&#xA0;</span>That night the king could not sleep. So one was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&#x2019;s eunuchs, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said, &#x201C;What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?&#x201D;And the king&#x2019;s servants who attended him said, &#x201C;Nothing has been done for him.&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>So the king said, &#x201C;Who <i>is</i> in the court?&#x201D; Now Haman had <i>just</i> entered the outer court of the king&#x2019;s palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>The king&#x2019;s servants said to him, &#x201C;Haman is there, standing in the court.&#x201D;And the king said, &#x201C;Let him come in.&#x201D;",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So Haman came in, and the king asked him, &#x201C;What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor?&#x201D;Now Haman thought in his heart, &#x201C;Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?&#x201D; ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And Haman answered the king, &#x201C;<i>For</i> the man whom the king delights to honor, ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>let a royal robe be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, which has a royal crest placed on its head. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Then let this robe and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king&#x2019;s most noble princes, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then parade him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him: &#x2018;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said to Haman, &#x201C;Hurry, take the robe and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits within the king&#x2019;s gate! Leave nothing undone of all that you have spoken.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>So Haman took the robe and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, &#x201C;Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Afterward Mordecai went back to the king&#x2019;s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, &#x201C;If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him.&#x201D;",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>While they <i>were</i> still talking with him, the king&#x2019;s eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared."
		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7&#xA0;</span>So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, &#x201C;What <i>is</i> your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what <i>is</i> your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!&#x201D;",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then Queen Esther answered and said, &#x201C;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king&#x2019;s loss.&#x201D;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, &#x201C;Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?&#x201D;",

			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So the Jews accepted the custom which they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them, ",
