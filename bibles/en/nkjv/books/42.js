			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1&#xA0;</span>Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled among us, ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife <i>was</i> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <i>was</i> Elizabeth. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division, ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And when Zacharias saw <i>him,</i> he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>But the angel said to him, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&#x2019;s womb. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x2018;to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,&#x2019;</span> and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&#x201D;",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And Zacharias said to the angel, &#x201C;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.&#x201D;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And the angel answered and said to him, &#x201C;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you these glad tidings. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>But behold, you will be mute and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their own time.&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he lingered so long in the temple. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he beckoned to them and remained speechless.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So it was, as soon as the days of his service were completed, that he departed to his own house. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on <i>me,</i> to take away my reproach among people.&#x201D;",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin&#x2019;s name <i>was</i> Mary. ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>And having come in, the angel said to her, &#x201C;Rejoice, highly favored <i>one,</i> the Lord <i>is</i> with you; blessed <i>are</i> you among women!&#x201D;",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>But when she saw <i>him,</i> she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>Then the angel said to her, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Jesus</span>. ",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.&#x201D;",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>Then Mary said to the angel, &#x201C;How can this be, since I do not know a man?&#x201D;",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>And the angel answered and said to her, &#x201C;<i>The</i> Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God. ",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren. ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>For with God nothing will be impossible.&#x201D;",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>Then Mary said, &#x201C;Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.&#x201D; And the angel departed from her.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah, ",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40&#xA0;</sup>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. ",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41&#xA0;</sup>And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. ",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42&#xA0;</sup>Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, &#x201C;Blessed <i>are</i> you among women, and blessed <i>is</i> the fruit of your womb! ",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43&#xA0;</sup>But why <i>is</i> this <i>granted</i> to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? ",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. ",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.&#x201D;",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46&#xA0;</sup>And Mary said:&#x201C;My soul magnifies the Lord,",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47&#xA0;</sup>And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48&#xA0;</sup>For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49&#xA0;</sup>For He who is mighty has done great things for me,And holy <i>is</i> His name.",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50&#xA0;</sup>And His mercy <i>is</i> on those who fear HimFrom generation to generation.",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51&#xA0;</sup>He has shown strength with His arm;He has scattered <i>the</i> proud in the imagination of their hearts.",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52&#xA0;</sup>He has put down the mighty from <i>their</i> thrones,And exalted <i>the</i> lowly.",
			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53&#xA0;</sup>He has filled <i>the</i> hungry with good things,And <i>the</i> rich He has sent away empty.",
			"54": "<sup class=\"versenum\">54&#xA0;</sup>He has helped His servant Israel,In remembrance of <i>His</i> mercy,",
			"55": "<sup class=\"versenum\">55&#xA0;</sup>As He spoke to our fathers,To Abraham and to his seed forever.&#x201D;",
			"56": "<sup class=\"versenum\">56&#xA0;</sup>And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.",
			"57": "<sup class=\"versenum\">57&#xA0;</sup>Now Elizabeth&#x2019;s full time came for her to be delivered, and she brought forth a son. ",
			"58": "<sup class=\"versenum\">58&#xA0;</sup>When her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her, they rejoiced with her.",
			"59": "<sup class=\"versenum\">59&#xA0;</sup>So it was, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him by the name of his father, Zacharias. ",
			"60": "<sup class=\"versenum\">60&#xA0;</sup>His mother answered and said, &#x201C;No; he shall be called John.&#x201D;",
			"61": "<sup class=\"versenum\">61&#xA0;</sup>But they said to her, &#x201C;There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.&#x201D; ",
			"62": "<sup class=\"versenum\">62&#xA0;</sup>So they made signs to his father&#x2014;what he would have him called.",
			"63": "<sup class=\"versenum\">63&#xA0;</sup>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, &#x201C;His name is John.&#x201D; So they all marveled. ",
			"64": "<sup class=\"versenum\">64&#xA0;</sup>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue <i>loosed,</i> and he spoke, praising God. ",
			"65": "<sup class=\"versenum\">65&#xA0;</sup>Then fear came on all who dwelt around them; and all these sayings were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea. ",
			"66": "<sup class=\"versenum\">66&#xA0;</sup>And all those who heard <i>them</i> kept <i>them</i> in their hearts, saying, &#x201C;What kind of child will this be?&#x201D; And the hand of the Lord was with him.",
			"67": "<sup class=\"versenum\">67&#xA0;</sup>Now his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:",
			"68": "<sup class=\"versenum\">68&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Blessed <i>is</i> the Lord God of Israel,For He has visited and redeemed His people,",
			"69": "<sup class=\"versenum\">69&#xA0;</sup>And has raised up a horn of salvation for usIn the house of His servant David,",
			"70": "<sup class=\"versenum\">70&#xA0;</sup>As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets,Who <i>have been</i> since the world began,",
			"71": "<sup class=\"versenum\">71&#xA0;</sup>That we should be saved from our enemiesAnd from the hand of all who hate us,",
			"72": "<sup class=\"versenum\">72&#xA0;</sup>To perform the mercy <i>promised</i> to our fathersAnd to remember His holy covenant,",
			"73": "<sup class=\"versenum\">73&#xA0;</sup>The oath which He swore to our father Abraham:",
			"74": "<sup class=\"versenum\">74&#xA0;</sup>To grant us that we,Being delivered from the hand of our enemies,Might serve Him without fear,",
			"75": "<sup class=\"versenum\">75&#xA0;</sup>In holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.",
			"76": "<sup class=\"versenum\">76&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest;For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,",
			"77": "<sup class=\"versenum\">77&#xA0;</sup>To give knowledge of salvation to His peopleBy the remission of their sins,",
			"78": "<sup class=\"versenum\">78&#xA0;</sup>Through the tender mercy of our God,With which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;",
			"79": "<sup class=\"versenum\">79&#xA0;</sup>To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death,To guide our feet into the way of peace.&#x201D;",
			"80": "<sup class=\"versenum\">80&#xA0;</sup>So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>And it came to pass in those days <i>that</i> a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. ",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Then the angel said to them, &#x201C;Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. ",

			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47&#xA0;</sup>And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. ",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48&#xA0;</sup>So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, &#x201C;Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously.&#x201D;",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49&#xA0;</sup>And He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father&#x2019;s business?&#x201D;</span> ",

			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And they all cried out at once, saying, &#x201C;Away with this <i>Man,</i> and release to us Barabbas&#x201D;&#x2014; ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>But they shouted, saying, &#x201C;Crucify <i>Him,</i> crucify Him!&#x201D;",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to them the third time, &#x201C;Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let <i>Him</i> go.&#x201D;",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and lamented Him. ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">For indeed the days are coming in which they will say, &#x2018;Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed!&#x2019;</span> ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">Then they will begin &#x2018;to say to the mountains, &#x201C;Fall on us!&#x201D; and to the hills, &#x201C;Cover us!&#x201D;&#x2019;</span> ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?&#x201D;</span>",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death. ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left. ",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>Then Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.&#x201D;</span>And they divided His garments and cast lots. ",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>And the people stood looking on. But even the rulers with them sneered, saying, &#x201C;He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.&#x201D;",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine, ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>and saying, &#x201C;If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.&#x201D;",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, &#x201C;If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.&#x201D;",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40&#xA0;</sup>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, &#x201C;Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? ",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41&#xA0;</sup>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong.&#x201D; ",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to Jesus, &#x201C;Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.&#x201D;",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43&#xA0;</sup>And Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.&#x201D;</span>",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. ",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. ",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46&#xA0;</sup>And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Father, &#x2018;into Your hands I commit My spirit.&#x2019;&#x201D;</span> Having said this, He breathed His last.",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47&#xA0;</sup>So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, &#x201C;Certainly this was a righteous Man!&#x201D;",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48&#xA0;</sup>And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, beat their breasts and returned. ",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49&#xA0;</sup>But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50&#xA0;</sup>Now behold, <i>there was</i> a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man. ",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51&#xA0;</sup>He had not consented to their decision and deed. <i>He was</i> from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God. ",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52&#xA0;</sup>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. ",
			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53&#xA0;</sup>Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb <i>that was</i> hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before. ",
			"54": "<sup class=\"versenum\">54&#xA0;</sup>That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near.",
			"55": "<sup class=\"versenum\">55&#xA0;</sup>And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid. ",
			"56": "<sup class=\"versenum\">56&#xA0;</sup>Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment."

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in shining garments. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then, as they were afraid and bowed <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said to them, &#x201C;Why do you seek the living among the dead? ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>saying, <span class=\"woj\">&#x2018;The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.&#x2019;</span>&#x201D;",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And they remembered His words. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary <i>the mother</i> of James, and the other <i>women</i> with them, who told these things to the apostles. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And they talked together of all these things which had happened. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not know Him.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>And He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;What kind of conversation <i>is</i> this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?&#x201D;</span>",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, &#x201C;Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and have You not known the things which happened there in these days?&#x201D;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;What things?&#x201D;</span>So they said to Him, &#x201C;The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Yes, and certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>When they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And certain of those <i>who were</i> with us went to the tomb and found <i>it</i> just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.&#x201D;",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</span> ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?&#x201D;</span> ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and He indicated that He would have gone farther. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>But they constrained Him, saying, &#x201C;Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.&#x201D; And He went in to stay with them.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, as He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke <i>it,</i> and gave it to them. ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>And they said to one another, &#x201C;Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?&#x201D; ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those <i>who were</i> with them gathered together, ",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&#x201D; ",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>And they told about the things <i>that had happened</i> on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Peace to you.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they had seen a spirit. ",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>And He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?</span> ",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.&#x201D;</span>",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40&#xA0;</sup>When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. ",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41&#xA0;</sup>But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Have you any food here?&#x201D;</span> ",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42&#xA0;</sup>So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. ",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43&#xA0;</sup>And He took <i>it</i> and ate in their presence.",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;These <i>are</i> the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and <i>the</i> Prophets and <i>the</i> Psalms concerning Me.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise</span><span class=\"woj\"> from the dead the third day,</span> ",

			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50&#xA0;</sup>And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them. ",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven. ",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52&#xA0;</sup>And they worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, ",
