			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>on the third day, behold, it happened that a man came from Saul&#x2019;s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And David said to him, &#x201C;Where have you come from?&#x201D;So he said to him, &#x201C;I have escaped from the camp of Israel.&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then David said to him, &#x201C;How did the matter go? Please tell me.&#x201D;And he answered, &#x201C;The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.&#x201D;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>So David said to the young man who told him, &#x201C;How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?&#x201D;",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Then the young man who told him said, &#x201C;As I happened by chance <i>to be</i> on Mount Gilboa, there was Saul, leaning on his spear; and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Now when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, &#x2018;Here I am.&#x2019; ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And he said to me, &#x2018;Who <i>are</i> you?&#x2019; So I answered him, &#x2018;I <i>am</i> an Amalekite.&#x2019; ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>He said to me again, &#x2018;Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, but my life still <i>remains</i> in me.&#x2019; ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>So I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that <i>was</i> on his head and the bracelet that <i>was</i> on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and <i>so did</i> all the men who <i>were</i> with him. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>So David said to him, &#x201C;How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2019;s anointed?&#x201D; ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Then David called one of the young men and said, &#x201C;Go near, <i>and</i> execute him!&#x201D; And he struck him so that he died. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>So David said to him, &#x201C;Your blood <i>is</i> on your own head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, &#x2018;I have killed the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2019;s anointed.&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, ",

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And David brought up the men who <i>were</i> with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, &#x201C;The men of Jabesh Gilead <i>were the ones</i> who buried Saul.&#x201D; ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, &#x201C;You <i>are</i> blessed of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And now may the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> show kindness and truth to you. I also will repay you this kindness, because you have done this thing. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.&#x201D;",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul&#x2019;s army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim; ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>and he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Ishbosheth, Saul&#x2019;s son, <i>was</i> forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Now Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then Abner said to Joab, &#x201C;Let the young men now arise and compete before us.&#x201D;And Joab said, &#x201C;Let them arise.&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, <i>followers</i> of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And each one grasped his opponent by the head and <i>thrust</i> his sword in his opponent&#x2019;s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Swords, which <i>is</i> in Gibeon. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>So there was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel <i>was as</i> fleet of foot as a wild gazelle. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>So Asahel pursued Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Then Abner looked behind him and said, &#x201C;<i>Are</i> you Asahel?&#x201D;He answered, &#x201C;I <i>am.</i>&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And Abner said to him, &#x201C;Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.&#x201D; But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>So Abner said again to Asahel, &#x201C;Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I face your brother Joab?&#x201D; ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot. So it was <i>that</i> as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which <i>is</i> before Giah by the road to the Wilderness of Gibeon. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became a unit, and took their stand on top of a hill. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Then Abner called to Joab and said, &#x201C;Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?&#x201D;",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>And Joab said, &#x201C;<i>As</i> God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren.&#x201D; ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David&#x2019;s servants nineteen men and Asahel. ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner&#x2019;s men, three hundred and sixty men who died. ",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father&#x2019;s tomb, which <i>was in</i> Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak."

		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.",

			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>and the sixth, Ithream, by David&#x2019;s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening <i>his hold</i> on the house of Saul.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And Saul had a concubine, whose name <i>was</i> Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So <i>Ishbosheth</i> said to Abner, &#x201C;Why have you gone in to my father&#x2019;s concubine?&#x201D;",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, &#x201C;<i>Am</i> I a dog&#x2019;s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman? ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has sworn to him&#x2014; ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.&#x201D; ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, &#x201C;Whose <i>is</i> the land?&#x201D; saying <i>also,</i> &#x201C;Make your covenant with me, and indeed my hand <i>shall be</i> with you to bring all Israel to you.&#x201D;",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And <i>David</i> said, &#x201C;Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul&#x2019;s daughter, when you come to see my face.&#x201D; ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>So David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul&#x2019;s son, saying, &#x201C;Give <i>me</i> my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.&#x201D; ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And Ishbosheth sent and took her from <i>her</i> husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Then her husband went along with her to Bahurim, weeping behind her. So Abner said to him, &#x201C;Go, return!&#x201D; And he returned.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, &#x201C;In time past you were seeking for David <i>to be</i> king over you. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Now then, do <i>it!</i> For the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has spoken of David, saying, &#x2018;By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.&#x2019;&#x201D; ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin. Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who <i>were</i> with him. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Then Abner said to David, &#x201C;I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.&#x201D; So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them. But Abner <i>was</i> not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>When Joab and all the troops that <i>were</i> with him had come, they told Joab, saying, &#x201C;Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.&#x201D; ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Then Joab came to the king and said, &#x201C;What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> you sent him away, and he has already gone? ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.&#x201D;",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>And when Joab had gone from David&#x2019;s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know <i>it.</i> ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>Now when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Afterward, when David heard <i>it,</i> he said, &#x201C;My kingdom and I <i>are</i> guiltless before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father&#x2019;s house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.&#x201D; ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, &#x201C;Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.&#x201D; And King David followed the coffin. ",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32&#xA0;</sup>So they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. ",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33&#xA0;</sup>And the king sang <i>a lament</i> over Abner and said:&#x201C;Should Abner die as a fool dies?",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34&#xA0;</sup>Your hands were not boundNor your feet put into fetters;As a man falls before wicked men, <i>so</i> you fell.&#x201D;Then all the people wept over him again.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>And when all the people came to persuade David to eat food while it was still day, David took an oath, saying, &#x201C;God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!&#x201D; ",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>Now all the people took note <i>of it,</i> and it pleased them, since whatever the king did pleased all the people. ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king&#x2019;s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner. ",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said to his servants, &#x201C;Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? ",

			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And they came there, all the way into the house, <i>as though</i> to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. ",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>when someone told me, saying, &#x2018;Look, Saul is dead,&#x2019; thinking to have brought good news, I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag&#x2014;the one who <i>thought</i> I would give him a reward for <i>his</i> news. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?&#x201D; ",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And David&#x2019;s heart condemned him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, &#x201C;I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Now when David arose in the morning, the word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> came to the prophet Gad, David&#x2019;s seer, saying, ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Go and tell David, &#x2018;Thus says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#x201C;I offer you three <i>things;</i> choose one of them for yourself, that I may do <i>it</i> to you.&#x201D;&#x2019;&#x201D; ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>So Gad came to David and told him; and he said to him, &#x201C;Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or shall you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days&#x2019; plague in your land? Now consider and see what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.&#x201D;",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And David said to Gad, &#x201C;I am in great distress. Please let us fall into the hand of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, for His mercies <i>are</i> great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> sent a plague upon Israel from the morning till the appointed time. From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand men of the people died. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And when the angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> relented from the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying the people, &#x201C;It is enough; now restrain your hand.&#x201D; And the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then David spoke to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> when he saw the angel who was striking the people, and said, &#x201C;Surely I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father&#x2019;s house.&#x201D;",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And Gad came that day to David and said to him, &#x201C;Go up, erect an altar to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.&#x201D; ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>So David, according to the word of Gad, went up as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> commanded. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Now Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming toward him. So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Then Araunah said, &#x201C;Why has my lord the king come to his servant?&#x201D;And David said, &#x201C;To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.&#x201D;",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Now Araunah said to David, &#x201C;Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever <i>seems</i> good to him. Look, <i>here are</i> oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>All these, O king, Araunah has given to the king.&#x201D;And Araunah said to the king, &#x201C;May the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God accept you.&#x201D;",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Then the king said to Araunah, &#x201C;No, but I will surely buy <i>it</i> from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> my God with that which costs me nothing.&#x201D; So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>And David built there an altar to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> heeded the prayers for the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel."
