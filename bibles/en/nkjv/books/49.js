			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>and raised <i>us</i> up together, and made <i>us</i> sit together in the heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ Jesus, ",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effective working of His power.",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.",

			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, ",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. ",

			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>one God and Father of all, who <i>is</i> above all, and through all, and in you all.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ&#x2019;s gift. ",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>(Now this, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;He ascended&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth? ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>He who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)",

			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind, ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart; ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>But you have not so learned Christ, ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus: ",

			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, putting away lying, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;</span><i>Let</i> <span class=\"oblique\">each one</span> <i>of you</i> <span class=\"oblique\">speak truth with his neighbor,&#x201D;</span> for we are members of one another. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Be angry, and do not sin&#x201D;</span>: do not let the sun go down on your wrath, ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>nor give place to the devil. ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with <i>his</i> hands what is good, that he may have something to give him who has need. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice. ",
