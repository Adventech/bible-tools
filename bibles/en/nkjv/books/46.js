			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>so that you come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, ",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe&#x2019;s <i>household,</i> that there are contentions among you. ",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>being defamed, we entreat. We have been made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn <i>you.</i> ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <i>you do</i> not <i>have</i> many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. ",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>For the kingdom of God <i>is</i> not in word but in power. ",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, whether <i>it was</i> I or they, so we preach and so you believed.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? ",

			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those <i>who are</i> Christ&#x2019;s at His coming. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Then <i>comes</i> the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>The last enemy <i>that</i> will be destroyed <i>is</i> death. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>For <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;He has put all things under His feet.&#x201D;</span> But when He says &#x201C;all things are put under <i>Him,</i>&#x201D; <i>it is</i> evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted. ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead? ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour? ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. ",

			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35&#xA0;</sup>But someone will say, &#x201C;How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?&#x201D; ",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36&#xA0;</sup>Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies. ",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37&#xA0;</sup>And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain&#x2014;perhaps wheat or some other <i>grain.</i> ",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38&#xA0;</sup>But God gives it a body as He pleases, and to each seed its own body.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39&#xA0;</sup>All flesh <i>is</i> not the same flesh, but <i>there is</i> one <i>kind of</i> flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, <i>and</i> another of birds.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40&#xA0;</sup><i>There are</i> also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial <i>is</i> one, and the <i>glory</i> of the terrestrial <i>is</i> another. ",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41&#xA0;</sup><i>There is</i> one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for <i>one</i> star differs from <i>another</i> star in glory.",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42&#xA0;</sup>So also <i>is</i> the resurrection of the dead. <i>The body</i> is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. ",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43&#xA0;</sup>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. ",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. ",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>And so it is written, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;The first man Adam became a living being.&#x201D;</span> The last Adam <i>became</i> a life-giving spirit.",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46&#xA0;</sup>However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual. ",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47&#xA0;</sup>The first man <i>was</i> of the earth, <i>made</i> of dust; the second Man <i>is</i> the Lord from heaven. ",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48&#xA0;</sup>As <i>was</i> the <i>man</i> of dust, so also <i>are</i> those <i>who are made</i> of dust; and as <i>is</i> the heavenly <i>Man,</i> so also <i>are</i> those <i>who are</i> heavenly. ",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49&#xA0;</sup>And as we have borne the image of the <i>man</i> of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly <i>Man.</i>",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50&#xA0;</sup>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption. ",
