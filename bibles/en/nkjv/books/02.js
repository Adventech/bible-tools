			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And Joseph died, all his brothers, and all that generation. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>And he said to his people, &#x201C;Look, the people of the children of Israel <i>are</i> more and mightier than we; ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and it happen, in the event of war, that they also join our enemies and fight against us, and <i>so</i> go up out of the land.&#x201D; ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh supply cities, Pithom and Raamses. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>So the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigor. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage&#x2014;in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of service in the field. All their service in which they made them serve <i>was</i> with rigor.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one <i>was</i> Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah; ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>and he said, &#x201C;When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see <i>them</i> on the birthstools, if it <i>is</i> a son, then you shall kill him; but if it <i>is</i> a daughter, then she shall live.&#x201D; ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, &#x201C;Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?&#x201D;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, &#x201C;Because the Hebrew women <i>are</i> not like the Egyptian women; for they <i>are</i> lively and give birth before the midwives come to them.&#x201D;",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very mighty. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And so it was, because the midwives feared God, that He provided households for them.",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of bulrushes for him, daubed it with asphalt and pitch, put the child in it, and laid <i>it</i> in the reeds by the river&#x2019;s bank. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens walked along the riverside; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And when she opened <i>it,</i> she saw the child, and behold, the baby wept. So she had compassion on him, and said, &#x201C;This is one of the Hebrews&#x2019; children.&#x201D;",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter said to her, &#x201C;Go.&#x201D; So the maiden went and called the child&#x2019;s mother. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Then Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter said to her, &#x201C;Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give <i>you</i> your wages.&#x201D; So the woman took the child and nursed him. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter, and he became her son. So she called his name Moses, saying, &#x201C;Because I drew him out of the water.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>So he looked this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were fighting, and he said to the one who did the wrong, &#x201C;Why are you striking your companion?&#x201D;",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then he said, &#x201C;Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?&#x201D;So Moses feared and said, &#x201C;Surely this thing is known!&#x201D; ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to water their father&#x2019;s flock. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>When they came to Reuel their father, he said, &#x201C;How <i>is it that</i> you have come so soon today?&#x201D;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And they said, &#x201C;An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock.&#x201D;",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>So he said to his daughters, &#x201C;And where <i>is</i> he? Why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Then Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>And she bore <i>him</i> a son. He called his name Gershom, for he said, &#x201C;I have been a stranger in a foreign land.&#x201D;",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened in the process of time that the king of Egypt died. Then the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>So God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. ",

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And the Angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush.

			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then He said, &#x201C;Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand <i>is</i> holy ground.&#x201D; ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Moreover He said, &#x201C;I <i>am</i> the God of your father&#x2014;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#x201D; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said: &#x201C;I have surely seen the oppression of My people who <i>are</i> in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>So He said, &#x201C;I will certainly be with you. And this <i>shall be</i> a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.&#x201D;",
