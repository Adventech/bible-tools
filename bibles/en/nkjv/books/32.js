			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1&#xA0;</span>Now the word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out against it; for their wickedness has come up before Me.&#x201D; ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>But the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was about to be broken up.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Then the mariners were afraid; and every man cried out to his god, and threw the cargo that <i>was</i> in the ship into the sea, to lighten the load. But Jonah had gone down into the lowest parts of the ship, had lain down, and was fast asleep.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So the captain came to him, and said to him, &#x201C;What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God; perhaps your God will consider us, so that we may not perish.&#x201D;",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And they said to one another, &#x201C;Come, let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this trouble <i>has come</i> upon us.&#x201D; So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to him, &#x201C;Please tell us! For whose cause <i>is</i> this trouble upon us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So he said to them, &#x201C;I <i>am</i> a Hebrew; and I fear the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry <i>land.</i>&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, &#x201C;Why have you done this?&#x201D; For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, because he had told them. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to him, &#x201C;What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?&#x201D;&#x2014;for the sea was growing more tempestuous.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And he said to them, &#x201C;Pick me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will become calm for you. For I know that this great tempest <i>is</i> because of me.&#x201D;",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land, but they could not, for the sea continued to grow more tempestuous against them. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Therefore they cried out to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and said, &#x201C;We pray, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, please do not let us perish for this man&#x2019;s life, and do not charge us with innocent blood; for You, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, have done as it pleased You.&#x201D; ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Then the men feared the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and took vows.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Now the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>Then Jonah prayed to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> his God from the fish&#x2019;s belly. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And he said:&#x201C;I cried out to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> because of my affliction,And He answered me.&#x201C;Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<i>And</i> You heard my voice.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>For You cast me into the deep,Into the heart of the seas,And the floods surrounded me;All Your billows and Your waves passed over me.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then I said, &#x2018;I have been cast out of Your sight;Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.&#x2019;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>The waters surrounded me, <i>even</i> to my soul;The deep closed around me;Weeds were wrapped around my head.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>I went down to the moorings of the mountains;The earth with its bars <i>closed</i> behind me forever;Yet You have brought up my life from the pit,O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, my God.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;When my soul fainted within me,I remembered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>;And my prayer went <i>up</i> to You,Into Your holy temple.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Those who regard worthless idolsForsake their own Mercy.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>But I will sacrifice to YouWith the voice of thanksgiving;I will pay what I have vowed.Salvation <i>is</i> of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry <i>land.</i>"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>Now the word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> came to Jonah the second time, saying, ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I tell you.&#x201D; ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three-day journey <i>in extent.</i> ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And Jonah began to enter the city on the first day&#x2019;s walk. Then he cried out and said, &#x201C;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!&#x201D;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>So the people of Nineveh believed God, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Then word came to the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne and laid aside his robe, covered <i>himself</i> with sackcloth and sat in ashes. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And he caused <i>it</i> to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying,Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; do not let them eat, or drink water. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God; yes, let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Who can tell <i>if</i> God will turn and relent, and turn away from His fierce anger, so that we may not perish?",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Then God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God relented from the disaster that He had said He would bring upon them, and He did not do it."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he became angry. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>So he prayed to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and said, &#x201C;Ah, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, was not this what I said when I was still in my country? Therefore I fled previously to Tarshish; for I know that You <i>are</i> a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Therefore now, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, please take my life from me, for <i>it is</i> better for me to die than to live!&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said, &#x201C;<i>Is it</i> right for you to be angry?&#x201D;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city. There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God prepared a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be shade for his head to deliver him from his misery. So Jonah was very grateful for the plant. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm, and it <i>so</i> damaged the plant that it withered. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And it happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah&#x2019;s head, so that he grew faint. Then he wished death for himself, and said, &#x201C;<i>It is</i> better for me to die than to live.&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Then God said to Jonah, &#x201C;<i>Is it</i> right for you to be angry about the plant?&#x201D;And he said, &#x201C;<i>It is</i> right for me to be angry, even to death!&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>But the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said, &#x201C;You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left&#x2014;and much livestock?&#x201D;"
