			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>saying, &#x201C;Let <i>us</i> alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are&#x2014;the Holy One of God!&#x201D;",

			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44&#xA0;</sup>and said to him, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;See that you say nothing to anyone; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&#x201D;</span>",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45&#xA0;</sup>However, he went out and began to proclaim <i>it</i> freely, and to spread the matter, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but was outside in deserted places; and they came to Him from every direction."

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four <i>men.</i> ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Son, your sins are forgiven you.&#x201D;</span>",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, ",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?</span> ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, &#x2018;<i>Your</i> sins are forgiven you,&#x2019; or to say, &#x2018;Arise, take up your bed and walk&#x2019;?</span> ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins&#x201D;</span>&#x2014;He said to the paralytic, ",

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>As He passed by, He saw Levi the <i>son</i> of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Follow Me.&#x201D;</span> So he arose and followed Him.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened, as He was dining in <i>Levi&#x2019;s</i> house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, &#x201C;How <i>is it</i> that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call <i>the</i> righteous, but sinners, to repentance.&#x201D;</span>",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, &#x201C;Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?&#x201D;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</span> ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup><span class=\"woj\">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.</span> ",

			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And the Pharisees said to Him, &#x201C;Look, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&#x201D;",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>But He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him:</span> ",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And He said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Step forward.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then He said to them, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?&#x201D;</span> But they kept silent. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, <span class=\"woj\">&#x201C;Stretch out your hand.&#x201D;</span> And he stretched <i>it</i> out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.
