			"4": "<sup>4</sup> What the chewing locust left, the swarming locust has eaten;\nWhat the swarming locust left, the crawling locust has eaten;\nAnd what the crawling locust left, the consuming locust has eaten.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Awake, you drunkards, and weep;\nAnd wail, all you drinkers of wine,\nBecause of the new wine,\nFor it has been cut off from your mouth.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> For a nation has come up against My land,\nStrong, and without number;\nHis teeth are the teeth of a lion,\nAnd he has the fangs of a fierce lion.",

			"12": "<sup>12</sup> The vine has dried up,\nAnd the fig tree has withered;\nThe pomegranate tree,\nThe palm tree also,\nAnd the apple tree—\nAll the trees of the field are withered;\nSurely joy has withered away from the sons of men.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Mourning for the Land\nGird yourselves and lament, you priests;\nWail, you who minister before the altar;\nCome, lie all night in sackcloth,\nYou who minister to my God;\nFor the grain offering and the drink offering\nAre withheld from the house of your God.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Consecrate a fast,\nCall a sacred assembly;\nGather the elders\nAnd all the inhabitants of the land\nInto the house of the Lord your God,\nAnd cry out to the Lord.",

			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Is not the food cut off before our eyes,\nJoy and gladness from the house of our God?",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> The seed shrivels under the clods,\nStorehouses are in shambles;\nBarns are broken down,\nFor the grain has withered.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> How the animals groan!\nThe herds of cattle are restless,\nBecause they have no pasture;\nEven the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> O Lord, to You I cry out;\nFor fire has devoured the open pastures,\nAnd a flame has burned all the trees of the field.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> The beasts of the field also cry out to You,\nFor the water brooks are dried up,\nAnd fire has devoured the open pastures."

			"13": "<sup>13</sup> So rend your heart, and not your garments;\nReturn to the Lord your God,\nFor He is gracious and merciful,\nSlow to anger, and of great kindness;\nAnd He relents from doing harm.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Who knows if He will turn and relent,\nAnd leave a blessing behind Him—\nA grain offering and a drink offering\nFor the Lord your God?",

			"20": "<sup>20</sup> “But I will remove far from you the northern army,\nAnd will drive him away into a barren and desolate land,\nWith his face toward the eastern sea\nAnd his back toward the western sea;\nHis stench will come up,\nAnd his foul odor will rise,\nBecause he has done monstrous things.”",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Fear not, O land;\nBe glad and rejoice,\nFor the Lord has done marvelous things!",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field;\nFor the open pastures are springing up,\nAnd the tree bears its fruit;\nThe fig tree and the vine yield their strength.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Be glad then, you children of Zion,\nAnd rejoice in the Lord your God;\nFor He has given you the former rain faithfully,\nAnd He will cause the rain to come down for you—\nThe former rain,\nAnd the latter rain in the first month.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> The threshing floors shall be full of wheat,\nAnd the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> “So I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,\nThe crawling locust,\nThe consuming locust,\nAnd the chewing locust,\nMy great army which I sent among you.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,\nAnd praise the name of the Lord your God,\nWho has dealt wondrously with you;\nAnd My people shall never be put to shame.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel:\nI am the Lord your God\nAnd there is no other.\nMy people shall never be put to shame.",

			"31": "<sup>31</sup> The sun shall be turned into darkness,\nAnd the moon into blood,\nBefore the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> And it shall come to pass\nThat whoever calls on the name of the Lord\nShall be saved.\nFor in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance,\nAs the Lord has said,\nAmong the remnant whom the Lord calls."
