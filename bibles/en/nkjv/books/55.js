			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1&#xA0;</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>To Timothy, a beloved son:Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as <i>my</i> forefathers <i>did,</i> as without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God, ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>who has saved us and called <i>us</i> with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began, ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, <i>who</i> has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>to which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very zealously and found <i>me.</i> ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day&#x2014;and you know very well how many ways he ministered <i>to me</i> at Ephesus."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of <i>this</i> life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel, ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, <i>even</i> to the point of chains; but the word of God is not chained. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup><i>This is</i> a faithful saying:For if we died with <i>Him,</i>We shall also live with <i>Him.</i>",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>If we endure,We shall also reign with <i>Him.</i>If we deny <i>Him,</i>He also will deny us.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>If we are faithless,He remains faithful;He cannot deny Himself.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Remind <i>them</i> of these things, charging <i>them</i> before the Lord not to strive about words to no profit, to the ruin of the hearers. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>But shun profane <i>and</i> idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: &#x201C;The Lord knows those who are His,&#x201D; and, &#x201C;Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.&#x201D;",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>and <i>that</i> they may come to their senses <i>and escape</i> the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to <i>do</i> his will."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away! ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra&#x2014;what persecutions I endured. And out of <i>them</i> all the Lord delivered me. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned <i>them,</i> ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>All Scripture <i>is</i> given by inspiration of God, and <i>is</i> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>I charge <i>you</i> therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom: ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Preach the word! Be ready in season <i>and</i> out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, <i>because</i> they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>and they will turn <i>their</i> ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Be diligent to come to me quickly; ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica&#x2014;Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas when you come&#x2014;and the books, especially the parchments.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>At my first defense no one stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the message might be preached fully through me, and <i>that</i> all the Gentiles might hear. Also I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve <i>me</i> for His heavenly kingdom. To Him <i>be</i> glory forever and ever. Amen!",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Erastus stayed in Corinth, but Trophimus I have left in Miletus sick.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Do your utmost to come before winter.Eubulus greets you, as well as Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen."
