			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them&#x2014;the children of Israel. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>No man shall <i>be able to</i> stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, <i>so</i> I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God <i>is</i> with you wherever you go.&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, &#x2018;Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you will cross over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess.&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying, ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Remember the word which Moses the servant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> commanded you, saying, &#x2018;The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land.&#x2019; ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them, ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>until the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has given your brethren rest, as He <i>gave</i> you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it, which Moses the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2019;s servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.&#x201D;",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>So they answered Joshua, saying, &#x201C;All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. ",

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>Now Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men from Acacia Grove to spy secretly, saying, &#x201C;Go, view the land, especially Jericho.&#x201D; So they went, and came to the house of a harlot named Rahab, and lodged there. ",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, &#x201C;Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the country.&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then the woman took the two men and hid them. So she said, &#x201C;Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they <i>were</i> from. ",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>and said to the men: &#x201C;I know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of you. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For we have heard how the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And as soon as we heard <i>these things,</i> our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God, He <i>is</i> God in heaven above and on earth beneath.

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father&#x2019;s house, and give me a true token, ",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>So the men answered her, &#x201C;Our lives for yours, if none of you tell this business of ours.

			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house <i>was</i> on the city wall; she dwelt on the wall. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And she said to them, &#x201C;Get to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward you may go your way.&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>So the men said to her: &#x201C;We <i>will be</i> blameless of this oath of yours which you have made us swear, ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>unless, <i>when</i> we come into the land, you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father&#x2019;s household to your own home. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>So it shall be <i>that</i> whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood <i>shall be</i> on his own head, and we <i>will be</i> guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood <i>shall be</i> on our head if a hand is laid on him. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you made us swear.&#x201D;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Then she said, &#x201C;According to your words, so <i>be</i> it.&#x201D; And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>They departed and went to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers sought <i>them</i> all along the way, but did not find <i>them.</i> ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And they said to Joshua, &#x201C;Truly the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the country are fainthearted because of us.&#x201D;"

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>So it was, after three days, that the officers went through the camp; ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>and they commanded the people, saying, &#x201C;When you see the ark of the covenant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed <i>this</i> way before.&#x201D;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And Joshua said to the people, &#x201C;Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will do wonders among you.&#x201D; ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Then Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, &#x201C;Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people.&#x201D;So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Joshua, &#x201C;This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, <i>so</i> I will be with you. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, &#x2018;When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you shall stand in the Jordan.&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So Joshua said to the children of Israel, &#x201C;Come here, and hear the words of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God.&#x201D; ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And Joshua said, &#x201C;By this you shall know that the living God <i>is</i> among you, and <i>that</i> He will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites: ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from every tribe. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, <i>that</i> the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they shall stand as a heap.&#x201D;",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>So it was, when the people set out from their camp to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest), ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>that the waters which came down from upstream stood <i>still, and</i> rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that <i>is</i> beside Zaretan. So the waters that went down into the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, failed, <i>and</i> were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Then the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan."
