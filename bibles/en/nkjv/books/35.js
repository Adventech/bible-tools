			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1&#xA0;</span>The burden which the prophet Habakkuk saw.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, how long shall I cry,And You will not hear?Even cry out to You, &#x201C;Violence!&#x201D;And You will not save.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Why do You show me iniquity,And cause <i>me</i> to see trouble?For plundering and violence <i>are</i> before me;There is strife, and contention arises.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law is powerless,And justice never goes forth.For the wicked surround the righteous;Therefore perverse judgment proceeds.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Look among the nations and watch&#x2014;Be utterly astounded!For <i>I will</i> work a work in your days<i>Which</i> you would not believe, though it were told <i>you.</i>",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>For indeed I am raising up the Chaldeans,A bitter and hasty nationWhich marches through the breadth of the earth,To possess dwelling places <i>that are</i> not theirs.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>They are terrible and dreadful;Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Their horses also are swifter than leopards,And more fierce than evening wolves.Their chargers charge ahead;Their cavalry comes from afar;They fly as the eagle <i>that</i> hastens to eat.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;They all come for violence;Their faces are set <i>like</i> the east wind.They gather captives like sand.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>They scoff at kings,And princes are scorned by them.They deride every stronghold,For they heap up earthen <i>mounds</i> and seize it.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then <i>his</i> mind changes, and he transgresses;He commits offense,<i>Ascribing</i> this power to his god.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Are You not from everlasting,O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> my God, my Holy One?We shall not die.O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, You have appointed them for judgment;O Rock, You have marked them for correction.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup><i>You are</i> of purer eyes than to behold evil,And cannot look on wickedness.Why do You look on those who deal treacherously,<i>And</i> hold Your tongue when the wicked devoursA <i>person</i> more righteous than he?",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup><i>Why</i> do You make men like fish of the sea,Like creeping things <i>that have</i> no ruler over them?",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>They take up all of them with a hook,They catch them in their net,And gather them in their dragnet.Therefore they rejoice and are glad.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Therefore they sacrifice to their net,And burn incense to their dragnet;Because by them their share <i>is</i> sumptuousAnd their food plentiful.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>Shall they therefore empty their net,And continue to slay nations without pity?"
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>I will stand my watchAnd set myself on the rampart,And watch to see what He will say to me,And what I will answer when I am corrected.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> answered me and said:&#x201C;Write the visionAnd make <i>it</i> plain on tablets,That he may run who reads it.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>For the vision <i>is</i> yet for an appointed time;But at the end it will speak, and it will not lie.Though it tarries, wait for it;Because it will surely come,It will not tarry.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Behold the proud,His soul is not upright in him;But the just shall live by his faith.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Indeed, because he transgresses by wine,<i>He is</i> a proud man,And he does not stay at home.Because he enlarges his desire as hell,And he <i>is</i> like death, and cannot be satisfied,He gathers to himself all nationsAnd heaps up for himself all peoples.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Will not all these take up a proverb against him,And a taunting riddle against him, and say,&#x2018;Woe to him who increases<i>What</i> is not his&#x2014;how long?And to him who loads himself with many pledges&#x2019;?",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Will not your creditors rise up suddenly?Will they not awaken who oppress you?And you will become their booty.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Because you have plundered many nations,All the remnant of the people shall plunder you,Because of men&#x2019;s bloodAnd the violence of the land <i>and</i> the city,And of all who dwell in it.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Woe to him who covets evil gain for his house,That he may set his nest on high,That he may be delivered from the power of disaster!",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>You give shameful counsel to your house,Cutting off many peoples,And sin <i>against</i> your soul.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For the stone will cry out from the wall,And the beam from the timbers will answer it.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Woe to him who builds a town with bloodshed,Who establishes a city by iniquity!",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Behold, <i>is it</i> not of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of hostsThat the peoples labor to feed the fire,And nations weary themselves in vain?",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>For the earth will be filledWith the knowledge of the glory of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>,As the waters cover the sea.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor,Pressing <i>him to</i> your bottle,Even to make <i>him</i> drunk,That you may look on his nakedness!",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>You are filled with shame instead of glory.You also&#x2014;drink!And be exposed as uncircumcised!The cup of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>&#x2019;s right hand <i>will be</i> turned against you,And utter shame will be on your glory.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For the violence <i>done to</i> Lebanon will cover you,And the plunder of beasts <i>which</i> made them afraid,Because of men&#x2019;s bloodAnd the violence of the land <i>and</i> the city,And of all who dwell in it.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;What profit is the image, that its maker should carve it,The molded image, a teacher of lies,That the maker of its mold should trust in it,To make mute idols?",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Woe to him who says to wood, &#x2018;Awake!&#x2019;To silent stone, &#x2018;Arise! It shall teach!&#x2019;Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,Yet in it there is no breath at all.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;But the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is in His holy temple.Let all the earth keep silence before Him.&#x201D;"

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, I have heard Your speech <i>and</i> was afraid;O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, revive Your work in the midst of the years!In the midst of the years make <i>it</i> known;In wrath remember mercy.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>God came from Teman,The Holy One from Mount Paran. <span class=\"selah\">Selah</span>His glory covered the heavens,And the earth was full of His praise.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup><i>His</i> brightness was like the light;He had rays <i>flashing</i> from His hand,And there His power <i>was</i> hidden.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Before Him went pestilence,And fever followed at His feet.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>He stood and measured the earth;He looked and startled the nations.And the everlasting mountains were scattered,The perpetual hills bowed.His ways <i>are</i> everlasting.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;The curtains of the land of Midian trembled.",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Your bow was made quite ready;Oaths were sworn over <i>Your</i> arrows. <span class=\"selah\">Selah</span>You divided the earth with rivers.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>The mountains saw You <i>and</i> trembled;The overflowing of the water passed by.The deep uttered its voice,<i>And</i> lifted its hands on high.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation;At the light of Your arrows they went,At the shining of Your glittering spear.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>You marched through the land in indignation;You trampled the nations in anger.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>You went forth for the salvation of Your people,For salvation with Your Anointed.You struck the head from the house of the wicked,By laying bare from foundation to neck. <span class=\"selah\">Selah</span>",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>You thrust through with his own arrowsThe head of his villages.They came out like a whirlwind to scatter me;Their rejoicing was like feasting on the poor in secret.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>You walked through the sea with Your horses,Through the heap of great waters.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>When I heard, my body trembled;My lips quivered at <i>the</i> voice;Rottenness entered my bones;And I trembled in myself,That I might rest in the day of trouble.When he comes up to the people,He will invade them with his troops.",
