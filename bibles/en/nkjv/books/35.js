			"2": "<sup>2</sup> The Prophet’s Question\nO Lord, how long shall I cry,\nAnd You will not hear?\nEven cry out to You, “Violence!”\nAnd You will not save.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Why do You show me iniquity,\nAnd cause me to see trouble?\nFor plundering and violence are before me;\nThere is strife, and contention arises.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Therefore the law is powerless,\nAnd justice never goes forth.\nFor the wicked surround the righteous;\nTherefore perverse judgment proceeds.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> The Lord’s Reply\n“Look among the nations and watch—\nBe utterly astounded!\nFor I will work a work in your days\nWhich you would not believe, though it were told you.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> For indeed I am raising up the Chaldeans,\nA bitter and hasty nation\nWhich marches through the breadth of the earth,\nTo possess dwelling places that are not theirs.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> They are terrible and dreadful;\nTheir judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Their horses also are swifter than leopards,\nAnd more fierce than evening wolves.\nTheir chargers charge ahead;\nTheir cavalry comes from afar;\nThey fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> “They all come for violence;\nTheir faces are set like the east wind.\nThey gather captives like sand.",

			"12": "<sup>12</sup> The Prophet’s Second Question\nAre You not from everlasting,\nO Lord my God, my Holy One?\nWe shall not die.\nO Lord, You have appointed them for judgment;\nO Rock, You have marked them for correction.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> You are of purer eyes than to behold evil,\nAnd cannot look on wickedness.\nWhy do You look on those who deal treacherously,\nAnd hold Your tongue when the wicked devours\nA person more righteous than he?",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Why do You make men like fish of the sea,\nLike creeping things that have no ruler over them?",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> They take up all of them with a hook,\nThey catch them in their net,\nAnd gather them in their dragnet.\nTherefore they rejoice and are glad.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Therefore they sacrifice to their net,\nAnd burn incense to their dragnet;\nBecause by them their share is sumptuous\nAnd their food plentiful.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Shall they therefore empty their net,\nAnd continue to slay nations without pity?"

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> The Just Live by Faith\nThen the Lord answered me and said:\n“Write the vision\nAnd make it plain on tablets,\nThat he may run who reads it.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> For the vision is yet for an appointed time;\nBut at the end it will speak, and it will not lie.\nThough it tarries, wait for it;\nBecause it will surely come,\nIt will not tarry.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> “Behold the proud,\nHis soul is not upright in him;\nBut the just shall live by his faith.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Woe to the Wicked\n“Indeed, because he transgresses by wine,\nHe is a proud man,\nAnd he does not stay at home.\nBecause he enlarges his desire as hell,\nAnd he is like death, and cannot be satisfied,\nHe gathers to himself all nations\nAnd heaps up for himself all peoples.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> “Will not all these take up a proverb against him,\nAnd a taunting riddle against him, and say,\n‘Woe to him who increases\nWhat is not his—how long?\nAnd to him who loads himself with many pledges’?",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Will not your creditors rise up suddenly?\nWill they not awaken who oppress you?\nAnd you will become their booty.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Because you have plundered many nations,\nAll the remnant of the people shall plunder you,\nBecause of men’s blood\nAnd the violence of the land and the city,\nAnd of all who dwell in it.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> “Woe to him who covets evil gain for his house,\nThat he may set his nest on high,\nThat he may be delivered from the power of disaster!",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> You give shameful counsel to your house,\nCutting off many peoples,\nAnd sin against your soul.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> For the stone will cry out from the wall,\nAnd the beam from the timbers will answer it.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> “Woe to him who builds a town with bloodshed,\nWho establishes a city by iniquity!",

			"14": "<sup>14</sup> For the earth will be filled\nWith the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,\nAs the waters cover the sea.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> “Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor,\nPressing him to your bottle,\nEven to make him drunk,\nThat you may look on his nakedness!",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> You are filled with shame instead of glory.\nYou also—drink!\nAnd be exposed as uncircumcised!\nThe cup of the Lord’s right hand will be turned against you,\nAnd utter shame will be on your glory.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For the violence done to Lebanon will cover you,\nAnd the plunder of beasts which made them afraid,\nBecause of men’s blood\nAnd the violence of the land and the city,\nAnd of all who dwell in it.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> “What profit is the image, that its maker should carve it,\nThe molded image, a teacher of lies,\nThat the maker of its mold should trust in it,\nTo make mute idols?",

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> God came from Teman,\nThe Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah\nHis glory covered the heavens,\nAnd the earth was full of His praise.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> His brightness was like the light;\nHe had rays flashing from His hand,\nAnd there His power was hidden.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Before Him went pestilence,\nAnd fever followed at His feet.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> He stood and measured the earth;\nHe looked and startled the nations.\nAnd the everlasting mountains were scattered,\nThe perpetual hills bowed.\nHis ways are everlasting.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;\nThe curtains of the land of Midian trembled.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> O Lord, were You displeased with the rivers,\nWas Your anger against the rivers,\nWas Your wrath against the sea,\nThat You rode on Your horses,\nYour chariots of salvation?",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Your bow was made quite ready;\nOaths were sworn over Your arrows. Selah\nYou divided the earth with rivers.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> The mountains saw You and trembled;\nThe overflowing of the water passed by.\nThe deep uttered its voice,\nAnd lifted its hands on high.",

			"15": "<sup>15</sup> You walked through the sea with Your horses,\nThrough the heap of great waters.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> When I heard, my body trembled;\nMy lips quivered at the voice;\nRottenness entered my bones;\nAnd I trembled in myself,\nThat I might rest in the day of trouble.\nWhen he comes up to the people,\nHe will invade them with his troops.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> A Hymn of Faith\nThough the fig tree may not blossom,\nNor fruit be on the vines;\nThough the labor of the olive may fail,\nAnd the fields yield no food;\nThough the flock may be cut off from the fold,\nAnd there be no herd in the stalls—",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Yet I will rejoice in the Lord,\nI will joy in the God of my salvation.",
