			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria, and was injured; so he sent messengers and said to them, &#x201C;Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury.&#x201D; ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>But the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Elijah the Tishbite, &#x201C;Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, &#x2018;<i>Is it</i> because <i>there is</i> no God in Israel <i>that</i> you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?&#x2019; ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Now therefore, thus says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#x2018;You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&#x2019;&#x201D; So Elijah departed.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, &#x201C;Why have you come back?&#x201D;",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So they said to him, &#x201C;A man came up to meet us, and said to us, &#x2018;Go, return to the king who sent you, and say to him, &#x201C;Thus says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#x2018;<i>Is it</i> because <i>there is</i> no God in Israel <i>that</i> you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to them, &#x201C;What kind of man <i>was it</i> who came up to meet you and told you these words?&#x201D;",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>So they answered him, &#x201C;A hairy man wearing a leather belt around his waist.&#x201D;And he said, &#x201C;It <i>is</i> Elijah the Tishbite.&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. So he went up to him; and there he was, sitting on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him: &#x201C;Man of God, the king has said, &#x2018;Come down!&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>So Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, &#x201C;If I <i>am</i> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.&#x201D; And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty men.And he answered and said to him: &#x201C;Man of God, thus has the king said, &#x2018;Come down quickly!&#x2019;&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>So Elijah answered and said to them, &#x201C;If I <i>am</i> a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.&#x201D; And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Again, he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and pleaded with him, and said to him: &#x201C;Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Look, fire has come down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fifties with their fifties. But let my life now be precious in your sight.&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>And the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Elijah, &#x201C;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&#x201D; So he arose and went down with him to the king. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to him, &#x201C;Thus says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#x2018;Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, <i>is it</i> because <i>there is</i> no God in Israel to inquire of His word?

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Then Elijah said to Elisha, &#x201C;Stay here, please, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has sent me on to Bethel.&#x201D;But Elisha said, &#x201C;<i>As</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!&#x201D; So they went down to Bethel.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Now the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i> at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, &#x201C;Do you know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will take away your master from over you today?&#x201D;And he said, &#x201C;Yes, I know; keep silent!&#x201D;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Then Elijah said to him, &#x201C;Elisha, stay here, please, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has sent me on to Jericho.&#x201D;But he said, &#x201C;<i>As</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!&#x201D; So they came to Jericho.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Now the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i> at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, &#x201C;Do you know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will take away your master from over you today?&#x201D;So he answered, &#x201C;Yes, I know; keep silent!&#x201D;",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Then Elijah said to him, &#x201C;Stay here, please, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has sent me on to the Jordan.&#x201D;But he said, &#x201C;<i>As</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!&#x201D; So the two of them went on. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing <i>them</i> at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Now Elijah took his mantle, rolled <i>it</i> up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, &#x201C;Ask! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?&#x201D;Elisha said, &#x201C;Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.&#x201D;",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;You have asked a hard thing. <i>Nevertheless,</i> if you see me <i>when I am</i> taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be <i>so.</i>&#x201D; ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly a chariot of fire <i>appeared</i> with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And Elisha saw <i>it,</i> and he cried out, &#x201C;My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!&#x201D; So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, &#x201C;Where <i>is</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God of Elijah?&#x201D; And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Now when the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i> from Jericho saw him, they said, &#x201C;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&#x201D; And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Then they said to him, &#x201C;Look now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, lest perhaps the Spirit of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.&#x201D;And he said, &#x201C;You shall not send anyone.&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, &#x201C;Send <i>them!</i>&#x201D; Therefore they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And when they came back to him, for he had stayed in Jericho, he said to them, &#x201C;Did I not say to you, &#x2018;Do not go&#x2019;?&#x201D;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Then the men of the city said to Elisha, &#x201C;Please notice, the situation of this city <i>is</i> pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water <i>is</i> bad, and the ground barren.&#x201D;",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>And he said, &#x201C;Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.&#x201D; So they brought <i>it</i> to him. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, &#x201C;Thus says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#x2018;I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.&#x2019;&#x201D; ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>So the water remains healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, &#x201C;Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!&#x201D;",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Then he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, but not like his father and mother; for he put away the <i>sacred</i> pillar of Baal that his father had made. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless he persisted in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder, and he regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>But it happened, when Ahab died, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, &#x201C;The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?&#x201D;And he said, &#x201C;I will go up; I <i>am</i> as you <i>are,</i> my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&#x201D; ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Then he said, &#x201C;Which way shall we go up?&#x201D;And he answered, &#x201C;By way of the Wilderness of Edom.&#x201D;",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched on that roundabout route seven days; and there was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>And the king of Israel said, &#x201C;Alas! For the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>But Jehoshaphat said, &#x201C;<i>Is there</i> no prophet of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> here, that we may inquire of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> by him?&#x201D;So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, &#x201C;Elisha the son of Shaphat <i>is</i> here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.&#x201D;",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>And Jehoshaphat said, &#x201C;The word of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is with him.&#x201D; So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, &#x201C;What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.&#x201D;But the king of Israel said to him, &#x201C;No, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has called these three kings <i>together</i> to deliver them into the hand of Moab.&#x201D;",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And Elisha said, &#x201C;<i>As</i> the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you, nor see you. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But now bring me a musician.&#x201D;Then it happened, when the musician played, that the hand of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> came upon him. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And he said, &#x201C;Thus says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#x2018;Make this valley full of ditches.&#x2019; ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For thus says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: &#x2018;You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you, your cattle, and your animals may drink.&#x2019; ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And this is a simple matter in the sight of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Also you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.&#x201D;",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that suddenly water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they stood at the border. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Then they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side <i>as</i> red as blood. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>And they said, &#x201C;This is blood; the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!&#x201D;",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and attacked the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered <i>their</i> land, killing the Moabites. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>Then they destroyed the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of Kir Haraseth <i>intact.</i> However the slingers surrounded and attacked it.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him <i>as</i> a burnt offering upon the wall; and there was great indignation against Israel. So they departed from him and returned to <i>their own</i> land."

		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>A certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, &#x201C;Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. And the creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves.&#x201D;",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>So Elisha said to her, &#x201C;What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?&#x201D; And she said, &#x201C;Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.&#x201D;",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Then he said, &#x201C;Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors&#x2014;empty vessels; do not gather just a few. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.&#x201D;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought <i>the vessels</i> to her; and she poured <i>it</i> out. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, &#x201C;Bring me another vessel.&#x201D;And he said to her, &#x201C;<i>There is</i> not another vessel.&#x201D; So the oil ceased. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, &#x201C;Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you <i>and</i> your sons live on the rest.&#x201D;",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there <i>was</i> a notable woman, and she persuaded him to eat some food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn in there to eat some food. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>And she said to her husband, &#x201C;Look now, I know that this <i>is</i> a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there.&#x201D;",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Then he said to Gehazi his servant, &#x201C;Call this Shunammite woman.&#x201D; When he had called her, she stood before him. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And he said to him, &#x201C;Say now to her, &#x2018;Look, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What <i>can I</i> do for you? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?&#x2019;&#x201D;She answered, &#x201C;I dwell among my own people.&#x201D;",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;What then <i>is</i> to be done for her?&#x201D;And Gehazi answered, &#x201C;Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old.&#x201D;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;Call her.&#x201D; When he had called her, she stood in the doorway. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Then he said, &#x201C;About this time next year you shall embrace a son.&#x201D;And she said, &#x201C;No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!&#x201D;",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>But the woman conceived, and bore a son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had told her.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>And he said to his father, &#x201C;My head, my head!&#x201D;So he said to a servant, &#x201C;Carry him to his mother.&#x201D; ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and <i>then</i> died. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut <i>the door</i> upon him, and went out. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>Then she called to her husband, and said, &#x201C;Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.&#x201D;",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>So he said, &#x201C;Why are you going to him today? <i>It is</i> neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.&#x201D;And she said, &#x201C;<i>It is</i> well.&#x201D; ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, &#x201C;Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.&#x201D; ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel.So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, &#x201C;Look, the Shunammite woman! ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Please run now to meet her, and say to her, &#x2018;<i>Is it</i> well with you? <i>Is it</i> well with your husband? <i>Is it</i> well with the child?&#x2019;&#x201D;And she answered, &#x201C;<i>It is</i> well.&#x201D; ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, &#x201C;Let her alone; for her soul <i>is</i> in deep distress, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has hidden <i>it</i> from me, and has not told me.&#x201D;",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>So she said, &#x201C;Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, &#x2018;Do not deceive me&#x2019;?&#x201D;",
