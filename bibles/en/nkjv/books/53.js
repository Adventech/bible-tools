			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup><i>which is</i> manifest evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer; ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>since <i>it is</i> a righteous thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>and to <i>give</i> you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of <i>this</i> calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of <i>His</i> goodness and the work of faith with power, ",

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Let no one deceive you by any means; for <i>that Day will not come</i> unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains <i>will do so</i> until He is taken out of the way. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>The coming of the <i>lawless one</i> is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth, ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given <i>us</i> everlasting consolation and good hope by grace, ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work."

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard <i>you</i> from the evil one. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you; ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>nor did we eat anyone&#x2019;s bread free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>But <i>as for</i> you, brethren, do not grow weary <i>in</i> doing good. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Yet do not count <i>him</i> as an enemy, but admonish <i>him</i> as a brother.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord <i>be</i> with you all.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so I write.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you all. Amen."
