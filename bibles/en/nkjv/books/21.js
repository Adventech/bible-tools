			"6": "<sup>6</sup> The wind goes toward the south,\nAnd turns around to the north;\nThe wind whirls about continually,\nAnd comes again on its circuit.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> All the rivers run into the sea,\nYet the sea is not full;\nTo the place from which the rivers come,\nThere they return again.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> All things are full of labor;\nMan cannot express it.\nThe eye is not satisfied with seeing,\nNor the ear filled with hearing.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> That which has been is what will be,\nThat which is done is what will be done,\nAnd there is nothing new under the sun.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Is there anything of which it may be said,\n“See, this is new”?\nIt has already been in ancient times before us.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> There is no remembrance of former things,\nNor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come\nBy those who will come after.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> The Grief of Wisdom\nI, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man, by which they may be exercised.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> What is crooked cannot be made straight,\nAnd what is lacking cannot be numbered.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> I communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has understood great wisdom and knowledge.”",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> For in much wisdom is much grief,\nAnd he who increases knowledge increases sorrow."

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> I searched in my heart how to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> I made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.",

			"7": "<sup>7</sup> I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, and musical instruments of all kinds.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> So I became great and excelled more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.\nI did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,\nFor my heart rejoiced in all my labor;\nAnd this was my reward from all my labor.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done\nAnd on the labor in which I had toiled;\nAnd indeed all was vanity and grasping for the wind.\nThere was no profit under the sun.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> The End of the Wise and the Fool\nThen I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly;\nFor what can the man do who succeeds the king?—\nOnly what he has already done.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Then I saw that wisdom excels folly\nAs light excels darkness.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> The wise man’s eyes are in his head,\nBut the fool walks in darkness.\nYet I myself perceived\nThat the same event happens to them all.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> So I said in my heart,\n“As it happens to the fool,\nIt also happens to me,\nAnd why was I then more wise?”\nThen I said in my heart,\n“This also is vanity.”",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For there is no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever,\nSince all that now is will be forgotten in the days to come.\nAnd how does a wise man die?\nAs the fool!",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me, for all is vanity and grasping for the wind.",

			"19": "<sup>19</sup> And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun?",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Nothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> For God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who is good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind."

			"18": "<sup>18</sup> I said in my heart, “Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals.”",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> So I perceived that nothing is better than that a man should rejoice in his own works, for that is his heritage. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?"

			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles,\nAnd your princes feast at the proper time—\nFor strength and not for drunkenness!",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Because of laziness the building decays,\nAnd through idleness of hands the house leaks.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> A feast is made for laughter,\nAnd wine makes merry;\nBut money answers everything.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Do not curse the king, even in your thought;\nDo not curse the rich, even in your bedroom;\nFor a bird of the air may carry your voice,\nAnd a bird in flight may tell the matter."
