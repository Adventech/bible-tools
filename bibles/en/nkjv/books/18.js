			"2": "<sup>2</sup> And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> And his sons would go and feast in their houses, each on his appointed day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did regularly.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Satan Attacks Job’s Character\nNow there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?”\nSo Satan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on his person.”\nSo Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Job Loses His Property and Children\nNow there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house;",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> when the Sabeans raided them and took them away—indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> And he said:\n“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked shall I return there.\nThe Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away;\nBlessed be the name of the Lord.”",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong."

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?”\nSatan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand, but spare his life.”",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Job’s Three Friends\nNow when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great."

			"11": "<sup>11</sup> “Why did I not die at birth?\nWhy did I not perish when I came from the womb?",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Why did the knees receive me?\nOr why the breasts, that I should nurse?",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> For now I would have lain still and been quiet,\nI would have been asleep;\nThen I would have been at rest",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> With kings and counselors of the earth,\nWho built ruins for themselves,",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Or with princes who had gold,\nWho filled their houses with silver;",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,\nLike infants who never saw light?",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease from troubling,\nAnd there the weary are at rest.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> There the prisoners rest together;\nThey do not hear the voice of the oppressor.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> The small and great are there,\nAnd the servant is free from his master.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> “Why is light given to him who is in misery,\nAnd life to the bitter of soul,",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Who long for death, but it does not come,\nAnd search for it more than hidden treasures;",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Who rejoice exceedingly,\nAnd are glad when they can find the grave?",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,\nAnd whom God has hedged in?",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> For my sighing comes before I eat,\nAnd my groanings pour out like water.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me,\nAnd what I dreaded has happened to me.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;\nI have no rest, for trouble comes.”"
