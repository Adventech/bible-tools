			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!&#x201D;",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, &#x201C;Your sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother&#x2019;s house, ",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Now when Job&#x2019;s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place&#x2014;Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him. ",
