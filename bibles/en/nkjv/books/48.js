			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>and all the brethren who are with me,To the churches of Galatia:",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>to whom <i>be</i> glory forever and ever. Amen.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught <i>it,</i> but <i>it came</i> through the revelation of Jesus Christ.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and <i>tried to</i> destroy it. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&#x2019;s womb and called <i>me</i> through His grace, ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those <i>who were</i> apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord&#x2019;s brother. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>(Now <i>concerning</i> the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which <i>were</i> in Christ. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>But they were hearing only, &#x201C;He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once <i>tried to</i> destroy.&#x201D; ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And they glorified God in me."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2&#xA0;</span>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with <i>me.</i> ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Yet not even Titus who <i>was</i> with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>And <i>this occurred</i> because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage), ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>But from those who seemed to be something&#x2014;whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows personal favoritism to no man&#x2014;for those who seemed <i>to be something</i> added nothing to me. ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as <i>the gospel</i> for the circumcised <i>was</i> to Peter ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles), ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we <i>should go</i> to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup><i>They desired</i> only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before <i>them</i> all, &#x201C;If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>We <i>who are</i> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>&#x201C;But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <i>is</i> Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not! ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <i>life</i> which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness <i>comes</i> through the law, then Christ died in vain.&#x201D;"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3&#xA0;</span>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified? ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh? ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>Have you suffered so many things in vain&#x2014;if indeed <i>it was</i> in vain?",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, <i>does He do it</i> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&#x2014; ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>just as Abraham <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore know that <i>only</i> those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, <i>saying,</i> <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;In you all the nations shall be blessed.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>So then those who <i>are</i> of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span class=\"oblique\">everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God <i>is</i> evident, for <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;the just shall live by faith.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Yet the law is not of faith, but <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;the man who does them shall live by them.&#x201D;</span>",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Cursed</span> <i>is</i> <span class=\"oblique\">everyone who hangs on a tree&#x201D;</span>),",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though <i>it is</i> only a man&#x2019;s covenant, yet <i>if it is</i> confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, &#x201C;And to seeds,&#x201D; as of many, but as of one, <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;And to your Seed,&#x201D;</span> who is Christ. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>And this I say, <i>that</i> the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>For if the inheritance <i>is</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no longer of promise; but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>What purpose then <i>does</i> the law <i>serve?</i> It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; <i>and it was</i> appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator. ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>Now a mediator does not <i>mediate</i> for one <i>only,</i> but God is one.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup><i>Is</i> the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>Therefore the law was our tutor <i>to bring us</i> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. ",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>And if you <i>are</i> Christ&#x2019;s, then you are Abraham&#x2019;s seed, and heirs according to the promise."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4&#xA0;</span>Now I say <i>that</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, &#x201C;Abba, Father!&#x201D; ",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how <i>is it that</i> you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>You observe days and months and seasons and years. ",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>I am afraid for you, lest I have labored for you in vain.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. You have not injured me at all. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. ",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>They zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. ",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? ",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar&#x2014; ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children&#x2014; ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. ",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27&#xA0;</sup>For it is written:<span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Rejoice, O barren,</span><i>You</i> <span class=\"oblique\">who do not bear!</span><span class=\"oblique\">Break forth and shout,</span><span class=\"oblique\">You who are not in labor!</span><span class=\"oblique\">For the desolate has many more children</span><span class=\"oblique\">Than she who has a husband.&#x201D;</span>",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28&#xA0;</sup>Now we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are children of promise. ",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29&#xA0;</sup>But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who was born</i> according to the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now. ",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30&#xA0;</sup>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31&#xA0;</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5&#xA0;</span>Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>You have become estranged from Christ, you who <i>attempt to</i> be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. ",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>This persuasion does not <i>come</i> from Him who calls you. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased. ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not <i>use</i> liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <i>even</i> in this: <span class=\"oblique\">&#x201C;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x201D;</span> ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. ",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. ",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19&#xA0;</sup>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, ",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20&#xA0;</sup>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, ",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21&#xA0;</sup>envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told <i>you</i> in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22&#xA0;</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, ",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23&#xA0;</sup>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. ",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24&#xA0;</sup>And those <i>who are</i> Christ&#x2019;s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. ",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25&#xA0;</sup>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. ",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26&#xA0;</sup>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6&#xA0;</span>Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who <i>are</i> spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted. ",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2&#xA0;</sup>Bear one another&#x2019;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. ",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3&#xA0;</sup>For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. ",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4&#xA0;</sup>But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. ",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5&#xA0;</sup>For each one shall bear his own load.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6&#xA0;</sup>Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7&#xA0;</sup>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. ",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8&#xA0;</sup>For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. ",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9&#xA0;</sup>And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. ",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10&#xA0;</sup>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11&#xA0;</sup>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12&#xA0;</sup>As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these <i>would</i> compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. ",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13&#xA0;</sup>For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. ",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14&#xA0;</sup>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. ",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15&#xA0;</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16&#xA0;</sup>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy <i>be</i> upon them, and upon the Israel of God.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17&#xA0;</sup>From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18&#xA0;</sup>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit. Amen."
