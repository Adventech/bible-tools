			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>On July 31 of my thirtieth year, while I was with the Judean exiles beside the Kebar River in Babylon, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>This happened during the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>(The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave this message to Ezekiel son of Buzi, a priest, beside the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians, and he felt the hand of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> take hold of him.)",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>As I looked, I saw a great storm coming from the north, driving before it a huge cloud that flashed with lightning and shone with brilliant light. There was fire inside the cloud, and in the middle of the fire glowed something like gleaming amber.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>From the center of the cloud came four living beings that looked human,",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>except that each had four faces and four wings.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Their legs were straight, and their feet had hooves like those of a calf and shone like burnished bronze.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Under each of their four wings I could see human hands. So each of the four beings had four faces and four wings.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>The wings of each living being touched the wings of the beings beside it. Each one moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Each had a human face in the front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle at the back.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Each had two pairs of outstretched wings—one pair stretched out to touch the wings of the living beings on either side of it, and the other pair covered its body.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>They went in whatever direction the spirit chose, and they moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>The living beings looked like bright coals of fire or brilliant torches, and lightning seemed to flash back and forth among them.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And the living beings darted to and fro like flashes of lightning.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>As I looked at these beings, I saw four wheels touching the ground beside them, one wheel belonging to each.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>The wheels sparkled as if made of beryl. All four wheels looked alike and were made the same; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The beings could move in any of the four directions they faced, without turning as they moved.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>The rims of the four wheels were tall and frightening, and they were covered with eyes all around.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>When the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. When they flew upward, the wheels went up, too.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. So wherever the spirit went, the wheels and the living beings also went.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>When the beings moved, the wheels moved. When the beings stopped, the wheels stopped. When the beings flew upward, the wheels rose up, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Spread out above them was a surface like the sky, glittering like crystal.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Beneath this surface the wings of each living being stretched out to touch the others’ wings, and each had two wings covering its body.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>As they flew, their wings sounded to me like waves crashing against the shore or like the voice of the Almighty or like the shouting of a mighty army. When they stopped, they let down their wings.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>As they stood with wings lowered, a voice spoke from beyond the crystal surface above them.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Above this surface was something that looked like a throne made of blue lapis lazuli. And on this throne high above was a figure whose appearance resembled a man.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>From what appeared to be his waist up, he looked like gleaming amber, flickering like a fire. And from his waist down, he looked like a burning flame, shining with splendor.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>All around him was a glowing halo, like a rainbow shining in the clouds on a rainy day. This is what the glory of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> looked like to me. When I saw it, I fell face down on the ground, and I heard someone’s voice speaking to me."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>“Stand up, son of man,” said the voice. “I want to speak with you.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The Spirit came into me as he spoke, and he set me on my feet. I listened carefully to his words.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>“Son of man,” he said, “I am sending you to the nation of Israel, a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have been rebelling against me to this very day.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>They are a stubborn and hard-hearted people. But I am sending you to say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says!’",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And whether they listen or refuse to listen—for remember, they are rebels—at least they will know they have had a prophet among them.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“Son of man, do not fear them or their words. Don’t be afraid even though their threats surround you like nettles and briers and stinging scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls, even though they are rebels.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. But they won’t listen, for they are completely rebellious!",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not join them in their rebellion. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me. It held a scroll,",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>which he unrolled. And I saw that both sides were covered with funeral songs, words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>The voice said to me, “Son of man, eat what I am giving you—eat this scroll! Then go and give its message to the people of Israel.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>“Fill your stomach with this,” he said. And when I ate it, it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then he said, “Son of man, go to the people of Israel and give them my messages.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>I am not sending you to a foreign people whose language you cannot understand.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>No, I am not sending you to people with strange and difficult speech. If I did, they would listen!",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>But the people of Israel won’t listen to you any more than they listen to me! For the whole lot of them are hard-hearted and stubborn.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But look, I have made you as obstinate and hard-hearted as they are.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>I have made your forehead as hard as the hardest rock! So don’t be afraid of them or fear their angry looks, even though they are rebels.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then he added, “Son of man, let all my words sink deep into your own heart first. Listen to them carefully for yourself.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then go to your people in exile and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says!’ Do this whether they listen to you or not.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me. (May the glory of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> be praised in his place!)",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>It was the sound of the wings of the living beings as they brushed against each other and the rumbling of their wheels beneath them.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I went in bitterness and turmoil, but the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s hold on me was strong.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Then I came to the colony of Judean exiles in Tel-abib, beside the Kebar River. I was overwhelmed and sat among them for seven days.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>After seven days the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave me a message. He said,",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel. Whenever you receive a message from me, warn people immediately.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>If I warn the wicked, saying, ‘You are under the penalty of death,’ but you fail to deliver the warning, they will die in their sins. And I will hold you responsible for their deaths.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>“If righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and ignore the obstacles I put in their way, they will die. And if you do not warn them, they will die in their sins. None of their righteous acts will be remembered, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>But if you warn righteous people not to sin and they listen to you and do not sin, they will live, and you will have saved yourself, too.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> took hold of me and said, “Get up and go out into the valley, and I will speak to you there.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>So I got up and went, and there I saw the glory of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, just as I had seen in my first vision by the Kebar River. And I fell face down on the ground.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Then the Spirit came into me and set me on my feet. He spoke to me and said, “Go to your house and shut yourself in.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>There, son of man, you will be tied with ropes so you cannot go out among the people.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be speechless and unable to rebuke them, for they are rebels.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>But when I give you a message, I will loosen your tongue and let you speak. Then you will say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says!’ Those who choose to listen will listen, but those who refuse will refuse, for they are rebels."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>“And now, son of man, take a large clay brick and set it down in front of you. Then draw a map of the city of Jerusalem on it.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Show the city under siege. Build a wall around it so no one can escape. Set up the enemy camp, and surround the city with siege ramps and battering rams.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Then take an iron griddle and place it between you and the city. Turn toward the city and demonstrate how harsh the siege will be against Jerusalem. This will be a warning to the people of Israel.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“Now lie on your left side and place the sins of Israel on yourself. You are to bear their sins for the number of days you lie there on your side.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>I am requiring you to bear Israel’s sins for 390 days—one day for each year of their sin.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>After that, turn over and lie on your right side for 40 days—one day for each year of Judah’s sin.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>“Meanwhile, keep staring at the siege of Jerusalem. Lie there with your arm bared and prophesy her destruction.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>I will tie you up with ropes so you won’t be able to turn from side to side until the days of your siege have been completed.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“Now go and get some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and emmer wheat, and mix them together in a storage jar. Use them to make bread for yourself during the 390 days you will be lying on your side.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Ration this out to yourself, eight ounces of food for each day, and eat it at set times.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then measure out a jar of water for each day, and drink it at set times.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Prepare and eat this food as you would barley cakes. While all the people are watching, bake it over a fire using dried human dung as fuel and then eat the bread.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said, “This is how Israel will eat defiled bread in the Gentile lands to which I will banish them!”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then I said, “O Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, must I be defiled by using human dung? For I have never been defiled before. From the time I was a child until now I have never eaten any animal that died of sickness or was killed by other animals. I have never eaten any meat forbidden by the law.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“All right,” the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said. “You may bake your bread with cow dung instead of human dung.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Then he told me, “Son of man, I will make food very scarce in Jerusalem. It will be weighed out with great care and eaten fearfully. The water will be rationed out drop by drop, and the people will drink it with dismay.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Lacking food and water, people will look at one another in terror, and they will waste away under their punishment."

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Place a third of it at the center of your map of Jerusalem. After acting out the siege, burn it there. Scatter another third across your map and chop it with a sword. Scatter the last third to the wind, for I will scatter my people with the sword.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Keep just a bit of the hair and tie it up in your robe.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then take some of these hairs out and throw them into the fire, burning them up. A fire will then spread from this remnant and destroy all of Israel.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“This is what the Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says: This is an illustration of what will happen to Jerusalem. I placed her at the center of the nations,",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>“Therefore, this is what the Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says: You people have behaved worse than your neighbors and have refused to obey my decrees and regulations. You have not even lived up to the standards of the nations around you.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Therefore, I myself, the Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, am now your enemy. I will punish you publicly while all the nations watch.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Because of your detestable idols, I will punish you like I have never punished anyone before or ever will again.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Parents will eat their own children, and children will eat their parents. I will punish you and scatter to the winds the few who survive.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>“As surely as I live, says the Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, I will cut you off completely. I will show you no pity at all because you have defiled my Temple with your vile images and detestable sins.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>A third of your people will die in the city from disease and famine. A third of them will be slaughtered by the enemy outside the city walls. And I will scatter a third to the winds, chasing them with my sword.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then at last my anger will be spent, and I will be satisfied. And when my fury against them has subsided, all Israel will know that I, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, have spoken to them in my jealous anger.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“So I will turn you into a ruin, a mockery in the eyes of the surrounding nations and to all who pass by.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>You will become an object of mockery and taunting and horror. You will be a warning to all the nations around you. They will see what happens when the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> punishes a nation in anger and rebukes it, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",

Disease and war will stalk your land, and I will bring the sword of the enemy against you. I, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, have spoken!”"
