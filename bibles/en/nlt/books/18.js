			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>There once was a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was blameless—a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil.",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was, in fact, the richest person in that entire area.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Job’s sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes, and they would also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>When these celebrations ended—sometimes after several days—Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, “Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>One day the members of the heavenly court came to present themselves before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them.",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Satan replied to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, “Yes, but Job has good reason to fear God.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper in everything he does. Look how rich he is!",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>“All right, you may test him,” the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan. “Do whatever you want with everything he possesses, but don’t harm him physically.” So Satan left the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s presence.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting at the oldest brother’s house,",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>a messenger arrived at Job’s home with this news: “Your oxen were plowing, with the donkeys feeding beside them,",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>when the Sabeans raided us. They stole all the animals and killed all the farmhands. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the shepherds. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>While he was still speaking, a third messenger arrived with this news: “Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news: “Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother’s home.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides. The house collapsed, and all your children are dead. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>He said, “I came naked from my mother’s womb,and I will be naked when I leave.The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave me what I had,and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has taken it away.Praise the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>!”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God."

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>One day the members of the heavenly court came again to present themselves before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“Where have you come from?” the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> asked Satan.Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, “I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that’s going on.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil. And he has maintained his integrity, even though you urged me to harm him without cause.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Satan replied to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, “Skin for skin! A man will give up everything he has to save his life.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>But reach out and take away his health, and he will surely curse you to your face!”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“All right, do with him as you please,” the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan. “But spare his life.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>So Satan left the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s presence, and he struck Job with terrible boils from head to foot.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery as he sat among the ashes.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>His wife said to him, “Are you still trying to maintain your integrity? Curse God and die.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But Job replied, “You talk like a foolish woman. Should we accept only good things from the hand of God and never anything bad?” So in all this, Job said nothing wrong.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>When three of Job’s friends heard of the tragedy he had suffered, they got together and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him. Their names were Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>When they saw Job from a distance, they scarcely recognized him. Wailing loudly, they tore their robes and threw dust into the air over their heads to show their grief.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights. No one said a word to Job, for they saw that his suffering was too great for words."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>At last Job spoke, and he cursed the day of his birth.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>He said:",

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Let that day be turned to darkness.Let it be lost even to God on high,and let no light shine on it.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Let the darkness and utter gloom claim that day for its own.Let a black cloud overshadow it,and let the darkness terrify it.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Let that night be blotted off the calendar,never again to be counted among the days of the year,never again to appear among the months.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Let that night be childless.Let it have no joy.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Let those who are experts at cursing—whose cursing could rouse Leviathan—curse that day.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Let its morning stars remain dark.Let it hope for light, but in vain;may it never see the morning light.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Curse that day for failing to shut my mother’s womb,for letting me be born to see all this trouble.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>“Why wasn’t I born dead?Why didn’t I die as I came from the womb?",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Why was I laid on my mother’s lap?Why did she nurse me at her breasts?",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Had I died at birth, I would now be at peace.I would be asleep and at rest.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>I would rest with the world’s kings and prime ministers,whose great buildings now lie in ruins.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>I would rest with princes, rich in gold,whose palaces were filled with silver.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Why wasn’t I buried like a stillborn child,like a baby who never lives to see the light?",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>For in death the wicked cause no trouble,and the weary are at rest.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Even captives are at ease in death,with no guards to curse them.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Rich and poor are both there,and the slave is free from his master.",

			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>I cannot eat for sighing;my groans pour out like water.",
