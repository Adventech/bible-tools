			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>She bought great quantities of gold, silver, jewels, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet cloth; things made of fragrant thyine wood, ivory goods, and objects made of expensive wood; and bronze, iron, and marble.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>She also bought cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, wagons, and bodies—that is, human slaves.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“The fancy things you loved so muchare gone,” they cry.“All your luxuries and splendorare gone forever,never to be yours again.”",

I am a servant of God, just like you and your brothers and sisters who testify about their faith in Jesus. Worship only God. For the essence of prophecy is to give a clear witness for Jesus.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God.",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The angel threw him into the bottomless pit, which he then shut and locked so Satan could not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were finished. Afterward he must be released for a little while.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then I saw thrones, and the people sitting on them had been given the authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony about Jesus and for proclaiming the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his statue, nor accepted his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They all came to life again, and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years.",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>He will go out to deceive the nations—called Gog and Magog—in every corner of the earth. He will gather them together for battle—a mighty army, as numberless as sand along the seashore.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>And I saw them as they went up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded God’s people and the beloved city. But fire from heaven came down on the attacking armies and consumed them.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then the devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the fiery lake of burning sulfur, joining the beast and the false prophet. There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And I saw a great white throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and sky fled from his presence, but they found no place to hide.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>I saw the dead, both great and small, standing before God’s throne. And the books were opened, including the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to what they had done, as recorded in the books.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>The sea gave up its dead, and death and the grave gave up their dead. And all were judged according to their deeds.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then death and the grave were thrown into the lake of fire. This lake of fire is the second death.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>And anyone whose name was not found recorded in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire."
		},
		"21": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">21 </span>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had disappeared. And the sea was also gone.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>I heard a loud shout from the throne, saying, “Look, God’s home is now among his people! He will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And the one sitting on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new!” And then he said to me, “Write this down, for what I tell you is trustworthy and true.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And he also said, “It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega—the Beginning and the End. To all who are thirsty I will give freely from the springs of the water of life.",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“But cowards, unbelievers, the corrupt, murderers, the immoral, those who practice witchcraft, idol worshipers, and all liars—their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls containing the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come with me! I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So he took me in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>It shone with the glory of God and sparkled like a precious stone—like jasper as clear as crystal.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The city wall was broad and high, with twelve gates guarded by twelve angels. And the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>There were three gates on each side—east, north, south, and west.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The angel who talked to me held in his hand a gold measuring stick to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>When he measured it, he found it was a square, as wide as it was long. In fact, its length and width and height were each 1,400 miles.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Then he measured the walls and found them to be 216 feet thick (according to the human standard used by the angel).",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>The wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold, as clear as glass.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The wall of the city was built on foundation stones inlaid with twelve precious stones: the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,",

			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>The twelve gates were made of pearls—each gate from a single pearl! And the main street was pure gold, as clear as glass.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>And the city has no need of sun or moon, for the glory of God illuminates the city, and the Lamb is its light.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the world will enter the city in all their glory.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Its gates will never be closed at the end of day because there is no night there.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>And all the nations will bring their glory and honor into the city.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Nothing evil will be allowed to enter, nor anyone who practices shameful idolatry and dishonesty—but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life."
		},
		"22": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">22 </span>Then the angel showed me a river with the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>It flowed down the center of the main street. On each side of the river grew a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, with a fresh crop each month. The leaves were used for medicine to heal the nations.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>No longer will there be a curse upon anything. For the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there, and his servants will worship him.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And they will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads.",
