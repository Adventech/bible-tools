			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>They used the eyewitness reports circulating among us from the early disciples.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write an accurate account for you, most honorable Theophilus,",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>so you can be certain of the truth of everything you were taught.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>When Herod was king of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah. He was a member of the priestly order of Abijah, and his wife, Elizabeth, was also from the priestly line of Aaron.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God’s eyes, careful to obey all of the Lord’s commandments and regulations.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>They had no children because Elizabeth was unable to conceive, and they were both very old.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>One day Zechariah was serving God in the Temple, for his order was on duty that week.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>As was the custom of the priests, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>While the incense was being burned, a great crowd stood outside, praying.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>While Zechariah was in the sanctuary, an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the incense altar.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Zechariah was shaken and overwhelmed with fear when he saw him.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But the angel said, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give you a son, and you are to name him John.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>You will have great joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He must never touch wine or other alcoholic drinks. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And he will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and he will cause those who are rebellious to accept the wisdom of the godly.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure this will happen? I’m an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Then the angel said, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to bring you this good news!",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>But now, since you didn’t believe what I said, you will be silent and unable to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly be fulfilled at the proper time.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the sanctuary, wondering why he was taking so long.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>When he finally did come out, he couldn’t speak to them. Then they realized from his gestures and his silence that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>When Zechariah’s week of service in the Temple was over, he returned home.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>“How kind the Lord is!” she exclaimed. “He has taken away my disgrace of having no children.”",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee,",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Gabriel appeared to her and said, “Greetings, favored woman! The Lord is with you!”",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>“Don’t be afraid, Mary,” the angel told her, “for you have found favor with God!",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>And he will reign over Israel forever; his Kingdom will never end!”",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Mary asked the angel, “But how can this happen? I am a virgin.”",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>What’s more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she has conceived a son and is now in her sixth month.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>For the word of God will never fail.”",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Mary responded, “I am the Lord’s servant. May everything you have said about me come true.” And then the angel left her.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>A few days later Mary hurried to the hill country of Judea, to the town",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>where Zechariah lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>At the sound of Mary’s greeting, Elizabeth’s child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary, “God has blessed you above all women, and your child is blessed.",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me?",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>When I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>You are blessed because you believed that the Lord would do what he said.”",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>Mary responded,“Oh, how my soul praises the Lord.",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>For he took notice of his lowly servant girl,and from now on all generations will call me blessed.",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>For the Mighty One is holy,and he has done great things for me.",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>He shows mercy from generation to generationto all who fear him.",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51 </sup>His mighty arm has done tremendous things!He has scattered the proud and haughty ones.",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52 </sup>He has brought down princes from their thronesand exalted the humble.",
			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53 </sup>He has filled the hungry with good thingsand sent the rich away with empty hands.",
			"54": "<sup class=\"versenum\">54 </sup>He has helped his servant Israeland remembered to be merciful.",
			"55": "<sup class=\"versenum\">55 </sup>For he made this promise to our ancestors,to Abraham and his children forever.”",
			"56": "<sup class=\"versenum\">56 </sup>Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home.",
			"57": "<sup class=\"versenum\">57 </sup>When it was time for Elizabeth’s baby to be born, she gave birth to a son.",
			"58": "<sup class=\"versenum\">58 </sup>And when her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very merciful to her, everyone rejoiced with her.",
			"59": "<sup class=\"versenum\">59 </sup>When the baby was eight days old, they all came for the circumcision ceremony. They wanted to name him Zechariah, after his father.",
			"60": "<sup class=\"versenum\">60 </sup>But Elizabeth said, “No! His name is John!”",
			"61": "<sup class=\"versenum\">61 </sup>“What?” they exclaimed. “There is no one in all your family by that name.”",
			"62": "<sup class=\"versenum\">62 </sup>So they used gestures to ask the baby’s father what he wanted to name him.",
			"63": "<sup class=\"versenum\">63 </sup>He motioned for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s surprise he wrote, “His name is John.”",
			"64": "<sup class=\"versenum\">64 </sup>Instantly Zechariah could speak again, and he began praising God.",
			"65": "<sup class=\"versenum\">65 </sup>Awe fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread throughout the Judean hills.",
			"66": "<sup class=\"versenum\">66 </sup>Everyone who heard about it reflected on these events and asked, “What will this child turn out to be?” For the hand of the Lord was surely upon him in a special way.",
			"67": "<sup class=\"versenum\">67 </sup>Then his father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:",
			"68": "<sup class=\"versenum\">68 </sup>“Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,because he has visited and redeemed his people.",
			"69": "<sup class=\"versenum\">69 </sup>He has sent us a mighty Saviorfrom the royal line of his servant David,",
			"70": "<sup class=\"versenum\">70 </sup>just as he promisedthrough his holy prophets long ago.",
			"71": "<sup class=\"versenum\">71 </sup>Now we will be saved from our enemiesand from all who hate us.",
			"72": "<sup class=\"versenum\">72 </sup>He has been merciful to our ancestorsby remembering his sacred covenant—",
			"73": "<sup class=\"versenum\">73 </sup>the covenant he swore with an oathto our ancestor Abraham.",
			"74": "<sup class=\"versenum\">74 </sup>We have been rescued from our enemiesso we can serve God without fear,",

			"76": "<sup class=\"versenum\">76 </sup>“And you, my little son,will be called the prophet of the Most High,because you will prepare the way for the Lord.",
			"77": "<sup class=\"versenum\">77 </sup>You will tell his people how to find salvationthrough forgiveness of their sins.",
			"78": "<sup class=\"versenum\">78 </sup>Because of God’s tender mercy,the morning light from heaven is about to break upon us,",
			"79": "<sup class=\"versenum\">79 </sup>to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,and to guide us to the path of peace.”",
			"80": "<sup class=\"versenum\">80 </sup>John grew up and became strong in spirit. And he lived in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>(This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David’s ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>He took with him Mary, to whom he was engaged, who was now expecting a child.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord’s glory surrounded them. They were terrified,",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>but the angel reassured them. “Don’t be afraid!” he said. “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David!",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>And you will recognize him by this sign: You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others—the armies of heaven—praising God and saying,",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“Glory to God in highest heaven,and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, “Let’s go to Bethlehem! Let’s see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>All who heard the shepherds’ story were astonished,",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as the angel had told them.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Then it was time for their purification offering, as required by the law of Moses after the birth of a child; so his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>The law of the Lord says, “If a woman’s first child is a boy, he must be dedicated to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>So they offered the sacrifice required in the law of the Lord—“either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>At that time there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon. He was righteous and devout and was eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come and rescue Israel. The Holy Spirit was upon him",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>and had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>That day the Spirit led him to the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required,",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>“Sovereign Lord, now let your servant die in peace,as you have promised.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>I have seen your salvation,",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>which you have prepared for all people.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>He is a light to reveal God to the nations,and he is the glory of your people Israel!”",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Jesus’ parents were amazed at what was being said about him.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Then Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary, the baby’s mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall, and many others to rise. He has been sent as a sign from God, but many will oppose him.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>As a result, the deepest thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your very soul.”",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Anna, a prophet, was also there in the Temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer.",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph, and she began praising God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>When Jesus’ parents had fulfilled all the requirements of the law of the Lord, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>There the child grew up healthy and strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God’s favor was on him.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival.",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>When Jesus was twelve years old, they attended the festival as usual.",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>After the celebration was over, they started home to Nazareth, but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents didn’t miss him at first,",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>because they assumed he was among the other travelers. But when he didn’t show up that evening, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>When they couldn’t find him, they went back to Jerusalem to search for him there.",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>Three days later they finally discovered him in the Temple, sitting among the religious teachers, listening to them and asking questions.",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>His parents didn’t know what to think. “Son,” his mother said to him, “why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere.”",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“But why did you need to search?”</span> he asked. <span class=\"woj\">“Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”</span>",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>But they didn’t understand what he meant.",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51 </sup>Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52 </sup>Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the people."

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. At this time a message from God came to John son of Zechariah, who was living in the wilderness.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Then John went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Isaiah had spoken of John when he said,“He is a voice shouting in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s coming!Clear the road for him!",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>When the crowds came to John for baptism, he said, “You brood of snakes! Who warned you to flee the coming wrath?",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. Don’t just say to each other, ‘We’re safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.’ That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones.",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The crowds asked, “What should we do?”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>John replied, “If you have two shirts, give one to the poor. If you have food, share it with those who are hungry.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Even corrupt tax collectors came to be baptized and asked, “Teacher, what should we do?”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>He replied, “Collect no more taxes than the government requires.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“What should we do?” asked some soldiers.John replied, “Don’t extort money or make false accusations. And be content with your pay.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come soon, and they were eager to know whether John might be the Messiah.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>John answered their questions by saying, “I baptize you with water; but someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>John used many such warnings as he announced the Good News to the people.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>John also publicly criticized Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, for marrying Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for many other wrongs he had done.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>So Herod put John in prison, adding this sin to his many others.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>One day when the crowds were being baptized, Jesus himself was baptized. As he was praying, the heavens opened,",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>and the Holy Spirit, in bodily form, descended on him like a dove. And a voice from heaven said, “You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy.”",

			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup><span class=\"woj\">So they dragged him out of the vineyard and murdered him.</span><span class=\"woj\">“What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do to them?”</span> Jesus asked.",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The teachers of religious law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they realized he was telling the story against them—they were the wicked farmers. But they were afraid of the people’s reaction.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Watching for their opportunity, the leaders sent spies pretending to be honest men. They tried to get Jesus to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor so he would arrest Jesus.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>“Teacher,” they said, “we know that you speak and teach what is right and are not influenced by what others think. You teach the way of God truthfully.",

			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>So they failed to trap him by what he said in front of the people. Instead, they were amazed by his answer, and they became silent.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees—religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>They posed this question: “Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother’s name.",

			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“But now, as to whether the dead will be raised—even Moses proved this when he wrote about the burning bush. Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, he referred to the Lord as ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</span>",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup><span class=\"woj\">So he is the God of the living, not the dead, for they are all alive to him.”</span>",

			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>Then, with the crowds listening, he turned to his disciples and said,",
