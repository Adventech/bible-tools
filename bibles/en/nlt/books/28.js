			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave this message to Hosea son of Beeri during the years when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>When the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> first began speaking to Israel through Hosea, he said to him, “Go and marry a prostitute, so that some of her children will be conceived in prostitution. This will illustrate how Israel has acted like a prostitute by turning against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and worshiping other gods.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>So Hosea married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she became pregnant and gave Hosea a son.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said, “Name the child Jezreel, for I am about to punish King Jehu’s dynasty to avenge the murders he committed at Jezreel. In fact, I will bring an end to Israel’s independence.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>I will break its military power in the Jezreel Valley.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Soon Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Hosea, “Name your daughter Lo-ruhamah—‘Not loved’—for I will no longer show love to the people of Israel or forgive them.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>But I will show love to the people of Judah. I will free them from their enemies—not with weapons and armies or horses and charioteers, but by my power as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> their God.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she again became pregnant and gave birth to a second son.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said, “Name him Lo-ammi—‘Not my people’—for Israel is not my people, and I am not their God.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“Yet the time will come when Israel’s people will be like the sands of the seashore—too many to count! Then, at the place where they were told, ‘You are not my people,’ it will be said, ‘You are children of the living God.’",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then the people of Judah and Israel will unite together. They will choose one leader for themselves, and they will return from exile together. What a day that will be—the day of Jezreel—when God will again plant his people in his land."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>“In that day you will call your brothers Ammi—‘My people.’ And you will call your sisters Ruhamah—‘The ones I love.’",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“But now bring charges against Israel—your mother—for she is no longer my wife,and I am no longer her husband.Tell her to remove the prostitute’s makeup from her faceand the clothing that exposes her breasts.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Otherwise, I will strip her as nakedas she was on the day she was born.I will leave her to die of thirst,as in a dry and barren wilderness.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And I will not love her children,for they were conceived in prostitution.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Their mother is a shameless prostituteand became pregnant in a shameful way.She said, ‘I’ll run after other loversand sell myself to them for food and water,for clothing of wool and linen,and for olive oil and drinks.’",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“For this reason I will fence her in with thornbushes.I will block her path with a wallto make her lose her way.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>When she runs after her lovers,she won’t be able to catch them.She will search for thembut not find them.Then she will think,‘I might as well return to my husband,for I was better off with him than I am now.’",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>She doesn’t realize it was I who gave her everything she has—the grain, the new wine, the olive oil;I even gave her silver and gold.But she gave all my gifts to Baal.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“But now I will take back the ripened grain and new wineI generously provided each harvest season.I will take away the wool and linen clothingI gave her to cover her nakedness.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>I will strip her naked in public,while all her lovers look on.No one will be ableto rescue her from my hands.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>I will put an end to her annual festivals,her new moon celebrations, and her Sabbath days—all her appointed festivals.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>I will destroy her grapevines and fig trees,things she claims her lovers gave her.I will let them grow into tangled thickets,where only wild animals will eat the fruit.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>I will punish her for all those timeswhen she burned incense to her images of Baal,when she put on her earrings and jewelsand went out to look for her loversbut forgot all about me,”says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“But then I will win her back once again.I will lead her into the desertand speak tenderly to her there.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>I will return her vineyards to herand transform the Valley of Trouble into a gateway of hope.She will give herself to me there,as she did long ago when she was young,when I freed her from her captivity in Egypt.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>When that day comes,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>,“you will call me ‘my husband’instead of ‘my master.’",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>O Israel, I will wipe the many names of Baal from your lips,and you will never mention them again.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>On that day I will make a covenantwith all the wild animals and the birds of the skyand the animals that scurry along the groundso they will not harm you.I will remove all weapons of war from the land,all swords and bows,so you can live unafraidin peace and safety.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>I will make you my wife forever,showing you righteousness and justice,unfailing love and compassion.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>I will be faithful to you and make you mine,and you will finally know me as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>“In that day, I will answer,”says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.“I will answer the sky as it pleads for clouds.And the sky will answer the earth with rain.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Then the earth will answer the thirsty criesof the grain, the grapevines, and the olive trees.And they in turn will answer,‘Jezreel’—‘God plants!’",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>At that time I will plant a crop of Israelitesand raise them for myself.I will show loveto those I called ‘Not loved.’And to those I called ‘Not my people,’I will say, ‘Now you are my people.’And they will reply, ‘You are our God!’”"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to me, “Go and love your wife again, even though she commits adultery with another lover. This will illustrate that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> still loves Israel, even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship them.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>So I bought her back for fifteen pieces of silver and five bushels of barley and a measure of wine.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Then I said to her, “You must live in my house for many days and stop your prostitution. During this time, you will not have sexual relations with anyone, not even with me.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>This shows that Israel will go a long time without a king or prince, and without sacrifices, sacred pillars, priests, or even idols!",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>But afterward the people will return and devote themselves to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> their God and to David’s descendant, their king. In the last days, they will tremble in awe of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and of his goodness."
		},

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>That is why your land is in mourning,and everyone is wasting away.Even the wild animals, the birds of the sky,and the fish of the sea are disappearing.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“Don’t point your finger at someone elseand try to pass the blame!My complaint, you priests,is with you.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>So you will stumble in broad daylight,and your false prophets will fall with you in the night.And I will destroy Israel, your mother.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>My people are being destroyedbecause they don’t know me.Since you priests refuse to know me,I refuse to recognize you as my priests.Since you have forgotten the laws of your God,I will forget to bless your children.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The more priests there are,the more they sin against me.They have exchanged the glory of Godfor the shame of idols.",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>‘And what the priests do, the people also do.’So now I will punish both priests and peoplefor their wicked deeds.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>They will eat and still be hungry.They will play the prostitute and gain nothing from it,for they have deserted the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to worship other gods.“Wine has robbed my peopleof their understanding.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>They ask a piece of wood for advice!They think a stick can tell them the future!Longing after idolshas made them foolish.They have played the prostitute,serving other gods and deserting their God.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>They offer sacrifices to idols on the mountaintops.They go up into the hills to burn incensein the pleasant shade of oaks, poplars, and terebinth trees.“That is why your daughters turn to prostitution,and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But why should I punish themfor their prostitution and adultery?For your men are doing the same thing,sinning with whores and shrine prostitutes.O foolish people! You refuse to understand,so you will be destroyed.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“Though you, Israel, are a prostitute,may Judah not be guilty of such things.Do not join the false worship at Gilgal or Beth-aven,and do not take oaths there in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s name.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Israel is stubborn,like a stubborn heifer.So should the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> feed herlike a lamb in a lush pasture?",
