			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>This letter is from Paul, an apostle. I was not appointed by any group of people or any human authority, but by Jesus Christ himself and by God the Father, who raised Jesus from the dead.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>All the brothers and sisters here join me in sending this letter to the churches of Galatia.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>May God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Jesus gave his life for our sins, just as God our Father planned, in order to rescue us from this evil world in which we live.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>All glory to God forever and ever! Amen.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Let God’s curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>I say again what we have said before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Obviously, I’m not trying to win the approval of people, but of God. If pleasing people were my goal, I would not be Christ’s servant.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Dear brothers and sisters, I want you to understand that the gospel message I preach is not based on mere human reasoning.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>I received my message from no human source, and no one taught me. Instead, I received it by direct revelation from Jesus Christ.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>You know what I was like when I followed the Jewish religion—how I violently persecuted God’s church. I did my best to destroy it.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>I was far ahead of my fellow Jews in my zeal for the traditions of my ancestors.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>But even before I was born, God chose me and called me by his marvelous grace. Then it pleased him",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>to reveal his Son to me so that I would proclaim the Good News about Jesus to the Gentiles.When this happened, I did not rush out to consult with any human being.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to consult with those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went away into Arabia, and later I returned to the city of Damascus.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Then three years later I went to Jerusalem to get to know Peter, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The only other apostle I met at that time was James, the Lord’s brother.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>I declare before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>After that visit I went north into the provinces of Syria and Cilicia.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>And still the churches in Christ that are in Judea didn’t know me personally.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>All they knew was that people were saying, “The one who used to persecute us is now preaching the very faith he tried to destroy!”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>And they praised God because of me."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>Then fourteen years later I went back to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabas; and Titus came along, too.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>I went there because God revealed to me that I should go. While I was there I met privately with those considered to be leaders of the church and shared with them the message I had been preaching to the Gentiles. I wanted to make sure that we were in agreement, for fear that all my efforts had been wasted and I was running the race for nothing.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And they supported me and did not even demand that my companion Titus be circumcised, though he was a Gentile.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Even that question came up only because of some so-called believers there—false ones, really—who were secretly brought in. They sneaked in to spy on us and take away the freedom we have in Christ Jesus. They wanted to enslave us and force us to follow their Jewish regulations.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>But we refused to give in to them for a single moment. We wanted to preserve the truth of the gospel message for you.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And the leaders of the church had nothing to add to what I was preaching. (By the way, their reputation as great leaders made no difference to me, for God has no favorites.)",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Instead, they saw that God had given me the responsibility of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the responsibility of preaching to the Jews.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>For the same God who worked through Peter as the apostle to the Jews also worked through me as the apostle to the Gentiles.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>In fact, James, Peter, and John, who were known as pillars of the church, recognized the gift God had given me, and they accepted Barnabas and me as their co-workers. They encouraged us to keep preaching to the Gentiles, while they continued their work with the Jews.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Their only suggestion was that we keep on helping the poor, which I have always been eager to do.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But when Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>When he first arrived, he ate with the Gentile believers, who were not circumcised. But afterward, when some friends of James came, Peter wouldn’t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of criticism from these people who insisted on the necessity of circumcision.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>As a result, other Jewish believers followed Peter’s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>When I saw that they were not following the truth of the gospel message, I said to Peter in front of all the others, “Since you, a Jew by birth, have discarded the Jewish laws and are living like a Gentile, why are you now trying to make these Gentiles follow the Jewish traditions?",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“You and I are Jews by birth, not ‘sinners’ like the Gentiles.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>But suppose we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ and then we are found guilty because we have abandoned the law. Would that mean Christ has led us into sin? Absolutely not!",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Rather, I am a sinner if I rebuild the old system of law I already tore down.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>For when I tried to keep the law, it condemned me. So I died to the law—I stopped trying to meet all its requirements—so that I might live for God.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>My old self has been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>I do not treat the grace of God as meaningless. For if keeping the law could make us right with God, then there was no need for Christ to die."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>Oh, foolish Galatians! Who has cast an evil spell on you? For the meaning of Jesus Christ’s death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law of Moses? Of course not! You received the Spirit because you believed the message you heard about Christ.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>How foolish can you be? After starting your new lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort?",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Have you experienced so much for nothing? Surely it was not in vain, was it?",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>I ask you again, does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law? Of course not! It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>In the same way, “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The real children of Abraham, then, are those who put their faith in God.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>What’s more, the Scriptures looked forward to this time when God would make the Gentiles right in his sight because of their faith. God proclaimed this good news to Abraham long ago when he said, “All nations will be blessed through you.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God’s Book of the Law.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, “It is through obeying the law that a person has life.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Through Christ Jesus, God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham, so that we who are believers might receive the promised Holy Spirit through faith.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Dear brothers and sisters, here’s an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or amend an irrevocable agreement, so it is in this case.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>God gave the promises to Abraham and his child. And notice that the Scripture doesn’t say “to his children,” as if it meant many descendants. Rather, it says “to his child”—and that, of course, means Christ.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>This is what I am trying to say: The agreement God made with Abraham could not be canceled 430 years later when God gave the law to Moses. God would be breaking his promise.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>For if the inheritance could be received by keeping the law, then it would not be the result of accepting God’s promise. But God graciously gave it to Abraham as a promise.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement. But God, who is one, did not use a mediator when he gave his promise to Abraham.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Is there a conflict, then, between God’s law and God’s promises? Absolutely not! If the law could give us new life, we could be made right with God by obeying it.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin, so we receive God’s promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Let me put it another way. The law was our guardian until Christ came; it protected us until we could be made right with God through faith.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>And now that the way of faith has come, we no longer need the law as our guardian.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God’s promise to Abraham belongs to you."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>Think of it this way. If a father dies and leaves an inheritance for his young children, those children are not much better off than slaves until they grow up, even though they actually own everything their father had.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>They have to obey their guardians until they reach whatever age their father set.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And that’s the way it was with us before Christ came. We were like children; we were slaves to the basic spiritual principles of this world.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, subject to the law.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law, so that he could adopt us as his very own children.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And because we are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, prompting us to call out, “Abba, Father.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Now you are no longer a slave but God’s own child. And since you are his child, God has made you his heir.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Before you Gentiles knew God, you were slaves to so-called gods that do not even exist.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>So now that you know God (or should I say, now that God knows you), why do you want to go back again and become slaves once more to the weak and useless spiritual principles of this world?",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>You are trying to earn favor with God by observing certain days or months or seasons or years.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>I fear for you. Perhaps all my hard work with you was for nothing.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to live as I do in freedom from these things, for I have become like you Gentiles—free from those laws.You did not mistreat me when I first preached to you.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Surely you remember that I was sick when I first brought you the Good News.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But even though my condition tempted you to reject me, you did not despise me or turn me away. No, you took me in and cared for me as though I were an angel from God or even Christ Jesus himself.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Where is that joyful and grateful spirit you felt then? I am sure you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if it had been possible.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Have I now become your enemy because I am telling you the truth?",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Those false teachers are so eager to win your favor, but their intentions are not good. They are trying to shut you off from me so that you will pay attention only to them.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>If someone is eager to do good things for you, that’s all right; but let them do it all the time, not just when I’m with you.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Oh, my dear children! I feel as if I’m going through labor pains for you again, and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>I wish I were with you right now so I could change my tone. But at this distance I don’t know how else to help you.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Tell me, you who want to live under the law, do you know what the law actually says?",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons, one from his slave wife and one from his freeborn wife.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>The son of the slave wife was born in a human attempt to bring about the fulfillment of God’s promise. But the son of the freeborn wife was born as God’s own fulfillment of his promise.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>These two women serve as an illustration of God’s two covenants. The first woman, Hagar, represents Mount Sinai where people received the law that enslaved them.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>And now Jerusalem is just like Mount Sinai in Arabia, because she and her children live in slavery to the law.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>But the other woman, Sarah, represents the heavenly Jerusalem. She is the free woman, and she is our mother.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>As Isaiah said, “Rejoice, O childless woman,you who have never given birth!Break into a joyful shout,you who have never been in labor!For the desolate woman now has more childrenthan the woman who lives with her husband!”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>And you, dear brothers and sisters, are children of the promise, just like Isaac.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>But you are now being persecuted by those who want you to keep the law, just as Ishmael, the child born by human effort, persecuted Isaac, the child born by the power of the Spirit.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>But what do the Scriptures say about that? “Get rid of the slave and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>So, dear brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman; we are children of the free woman."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>So Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don’t get tied up again in slavery to the law.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Listen! I, Paul, tell you this: If you are counting on circumcision to make you right with God, then Christ will be of no benefit to you.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>I’ll say it again. If you are trying to find favor with God by being circumcised, you must obey every regulation in the whole law of Moses.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God’s grace.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>But we who live by the Spirit eagerly wait to receive by faith the righteousness God has promised to us.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>For when we place our faith in Christ Jesus, there is no benefit in being circumcised or being uncircumcised. What is important is faith expressing itself in love.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>You were running the race so well. Who has held you back from following the truth?",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>It certainly isn’t God, for he is the one who called you to freedom.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough!",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>I am trusting the Lord to keep you from believing false teachings. God will judge that person, whoever he is, who has been confusing you.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Dear brothers and sisters, if I were still preaching that you must be circumcised—as some say I do—why am I still being persecuted? If I were no longer preaching salvation through the cross of Christ, no one would be offended.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would mutilate themselves.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters. But don’t use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit’s leading in every part of our lives.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>Dear brothers and sisters, if another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path. And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Share each other’s burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself. You are not that important.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won’t need to compare yourself to anyone else.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>For we are each responsible for our own conduct.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Those who are taught the word of God should provide for their teachers, sharing all good things with them.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Don’t be misled—you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>So let’s not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don’t give up.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone—especially to those in the family of faith.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Notice what large letters i use as i write these closing words in my own handwriting.</span>",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Those who are trying to force you to be circumcised want to look good to others. They don’t want to be persecuted for teaching that the cross of Christ alone can save.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>And even those who advocate circumcision don’t keep the whole law themselves. They only want you to be circumcised so they can boast about it and claim you as their disciples.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world’s interest in me has also died.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>It doesn’t matter whether we have been circumcised or not. What counts is whether we have been transformed into a new creation.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>May God’s peace and mercy be upon all who live by this principle; they are the new people of God.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>From now on, don’t let anyone trouble me with these things. For I bear on my body the scars that show I belong to Jesus.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Dear brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
