			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>In November of the second year of King Darius’s reign, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave this message to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah and grandson of Iddo:",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“I, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, was very angry with your ancestors.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Therefore, say to the people, ‘This is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says: Return to me, and I will return to you, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.’",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Don’t be like your ancestors who would not listen or pay attention when the earlier prophets said to them, ‘This is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says: Turn from your evil ways, and stop all your evil practices.’",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“Where are your ancestors now? They and the prophets are long dead.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>But everything I said through my servants the prophets happened to your ancestors, just as I said. As a result, they repented and said, ‘We have received what we deserved from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. He has done what he said he would do.’”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Three months later, on February 15, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> sent another message to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah and grandson of Iddo.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>In a vision during the night, I saw a man sitting on a red horse that was standing among some myrtle trees in a small valley. Behind him were riders on red, brown, and white horses.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>I asked the angel who was talking with me, “My lord, what do these horses mean?”“I will show you,” the angel replied.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The rider standing among the myrtle trees then explained, “They are the ones the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has sent out to patrol the earth.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then the other riders reported to the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have been patrolling the earth, and the whole earth is at peace.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Upon hearing this, the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> prayed this prayer: “O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, for seventy years now you have been angry with Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. How long until you again show mercy to them?”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then the angel said to me, “Shout this message for all to hear: ‘This is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says: My love for Jerusalem and Mount Zion is passionate and strong.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>But I am very angry with the other nations that are now enjoying peace and security. I was only a little angry with my people, but the nations inflicted harm on them far beyond my intentions.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>“‘Therefore, this is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says: I have returned to show mercy to Jerusalem. My Temple will be rebuilt, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, and measurements will be taken for the reconstruction of Jerusalem.’",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“Say this also: ‘This is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says: The towns of Israel will again overflow with prosperity, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem as his own.’”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Then I looked up and saw four animal horns.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>“What are these?” I asked the angel who was talking with me.He replied, “These horns represent the nations that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> showed me four blacksmiths.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>“What are these men coming to do?” I asked.The angel replied, “These four horns—these nations—scattered and humbled Judah. Now these blacksmiths have come to terrify those nations and throw them down and destroy them.”"

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>When I looked again, I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“Where are you going?” I asked.He replied, “I am going to measure Jerusalem, to see how wide and how long it is.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Then the angel who was with me went to meet a second angel who was coming toward him.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>The other angel said, “Hurry, and say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem will someday be so full of people and livestock that there won’t be room enough for everyone! Many will live outside the city walls.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then I, myself, will be a protective wall of fire around Jerusalem, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. And I will be the glory inside the city!’”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says, “Come away! Flee from Babylon in the land of the north, for I have scattered you to the four winds.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Come away, people of Zion, you who are exiled in Babylon!”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>After a period of glory, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies sent me against the nations who plundered you. For he said, “Anyone who harms you harms my most precious possession.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>I will raise my fist to crush them, and their own slaves will plunder them.” Then you will know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has sent me.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says, “Shout and rejoice, O beautiful Jerusalem, for I am coming to live among you.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Many nations will join themselves to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> on that day, and they, too, will be my people. I will live among you, and you will know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies sent me to you.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The land of Judah will be the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s special possession in the holy land, and he will once again choose Jerusalem to be his own city.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Be silent before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, all humanity, for he is springing into action from his holy dwelling.”"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>Then the angel showed me Jeshua the high priest standing before the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. The Accuser, Satan, was there at the angel’s right hand, making accusations against Jeshua.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Satan, “I, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, reject your accusations, Satan. Yes, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. This man is like a burning stick that has been snatched from the fire.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Jeshua’s clothing was filthy as he stood there before the angel.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>So the angel said to the others standing there, “Take off his filthy clothes.” And turning to Jeshua he said, “See, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then I said, “They should also place a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean priestly turban on his head and dressed him in new clothes while the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> stood by.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Then the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke very solemnly to Jeshua and said,",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>“This is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says: If you follow my ways and carefully serve me, then you will be given authority over my Temple and its courtyards. I will let you walk among these others standing here.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“Listen to me, O Jeshua the high priest, and all you other priests. You are symbols of things to come. Soon I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Now look at the jewel I have set before Jeshua, a single stone with seven facets. I will engrave an inscription on it, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, and I will remove the sins of this land in a single day.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“And on that day, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, each of you will invite your neighbor to sit with you peacefully under your own grapevine and fig tree.”"
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>Then the angel who had been talking with me returned and woke me, as though I had been asleep.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“What do you see now?” he asked.I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl of oil on top of it. Around the bowl are seven lamps, each having seven spouts with wicks.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And I see two olive trees, one on each side of the bowl.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then I asked the angel, “What are these, my lord? What do they mean?”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“Don’t you know?” the angel asked.“No, my lord,” I replied.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Then he said to me, “This is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says to Zerubbabel: It is not by force nor by strength, but by my Spirit, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Nothing, not even a mighty mountain, will stand in Zerubbabel’s way; it will become a level plain before him! And when Zerubbabel sets the final stone of the Temple in place, the people will shout: ‘May God bless it! May God bless it!’”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Then another message came to me from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>:",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“Zerubbabel is the one who laid the foundation of this Temple, and he will complete it. Then you will know that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies has sent me.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Do not despise these small beginnings, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> rejoices to see the work begin, to see the plumb line in Zerubbabel’s hand.” (The seven lamps represent the eyes of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> that search all around the world.)",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on each side of the lampstand,",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>and what are the two olive branches that pour out golden oil through two gold tubes?”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>“Don’t you know?” he asked.“No, my lord,” I replied.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then he said to me, “They represent the two anointed ones who stand in the court of the Lord of all the earth.”"
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>I looked up again and saw a scroll flying through the air.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“What do you see?” the angel asked.“I see a flying scroll,” I replied. “It appears to be about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Then he said to me, “This scroll contains the curse that is going out over the entire land. One side of the scroll says that those who steal will be banished from the land; the other side says that those who swear falsely will be banished from the land.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And this is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says: I am sending this curse into the house of every thief and into the house of everyone who swears falsely using my name. And my curse will remain in that house and completely destroy it—even its timbers and stones.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said, “Look up and see what’s coming.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“What is it?” I asked.He replied, “It is a basket for measuring grain, and it’s filled with the sins of everyone throughout the land.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Then the heavy lead cover was lifted off the basket, and there was a woman sitting inside it.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>The angel said, “The woman’s name is Wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and closed the heavy lid again.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then I looked up and saw two women flying toward us, gliding on the wind. They had wings like a stork, and they picked up the basket and flew into the sky.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>He replied, “To the land of Babylonia, where they will build a temple for the basket. And when the temple is ready, they will set the basket there on its pedestal.”"
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The first chariot was pulled by red horses, the second by black horses,",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>the third by white horses, and the fourth by powerful dappled-gray horses.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“And what are these, my lord?” I asked the angel who was talking with me.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The angel replied, “These are the four spirits of heaven who stand before the Lord of all the earth. They are going out to do his work.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>The chariot with black horses is going north, the chariot with white horses is going west, and the chariot with dappled-gray horses is going south.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The powerful horses were eager to set out to patrol the earth. And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said, “Go and patrol the earth!” So they left at once on their patrol.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> summoned me and said, “Look, those who went north have vented the anger of my Spirit there in the land of the north.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then I received another message from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>:",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah will bring gifts of silver and gold from the Jews exiled in Babylon. As soon as they arrive, meet them at the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Accept their gifts, and make a crown from the silver and gold. Then put the crown on the head of Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.",

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Yes, he will build the Temple of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. Then he will receive royal honor and will rule as king from his throne. He will also serve as priest from his throne, and there will be perfect harmony between his two roles.’",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“The crown will be a memorial in the Temple of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> to honor those who gave it—Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Josiah son of Zephaniah.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>People will come from distant lands to rebuild the Temple of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. And when this happens, you will know that my messages have been from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. All this will happen if you carefully obey what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God says."
