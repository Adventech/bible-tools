			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Attention! Let all the people of the world listen!Let the earth and everything in it hear.The Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is making accusations against you;the Lord speaks from his holy Temple.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Look! The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is coming!He leaves his throne in heavenand tramples the heights of the earth.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>The mountains melt beneath his feetand flow into the valleyslike wax in a fire,like water pouring down a hill.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And why is this happening?Because of the rebellion of Israel—yes, the sins of the whole nation.Who is to blame for Israel’s rebellion?Samaria, its capital city!Where is the center of idolatry in Judah?In Jerusalem, its capital!",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“So I, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, will make the city of Samariaa heap of ruins.Her streets will be plowed upfor planting vineyards.I will roll the stones of her walls into the valley below,exposing her foundations.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>All her carved images will be smashed.All her sacred treasures will be burned.These things were bought with the moneyearned by her prostitution,and they will now be carried awayto pay prostitutes elsewhere.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Therefore, I will mourn and lament.I will walk around barefoot and naked.I will howl like a jackaland moan like an owl.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>For my people’s woundis too deep to heal.It has reached into Judah,even to the gates of Jerusalem.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Don’t tell our enemies in Gath;don’t weep at all.You people in Beth-leaphrah,roll in the dust to show your despair.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>You people in Shaphir,go as captives into exile—naked and ashamed.The people of Zaanandare not come outside their walls.The people of Beth-ezel mourn,for their house has no support.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The people of Maroth anxiously wait for relief,but only bitterness awaits themas the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s judgment reacheseven to the gates of Jerusalem.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Harness your chariot horses and flee,you people of Lachish.You were the first city in Judahto follow Israel in her rebellion,and you led Jerusalem into sin.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;there is no hope of saving it.The town of Aczibhas deceived the kings of Israel.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>O people of Mareshah,I will bring a conqueror to capture your town.And the leaders of Israelwill go to Adullam.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Oh, people of Judah, shave your heads in sorrow,for the children you love will be snatched away.Make yourselves as bald as a vulture,for your little ones will be exiled to distant lands."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>What sorrow awaits you who lie awake at night,thinking up evil plans.You rise at dawn and hurry to carry them out,simply because you have the power to do so.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>When you want a piece of land,you find a way to seize it.When you want someone’s house,you take it by fraud and violence.You cheat a man of his property,stealing his family’s inheritance.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>But this is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says:“I will reward your evil with evil;you won’t be able to pull your neck out of the noose.You will no longer walk around proudly,for it will be a terrible time.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>In that day your enemies will make fun of youby singing this song of despair about you:“We are finished,completely ruined!God has confiscated our land,taking it from us.He has given our fieldsto those who betrayed us.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Others will set your boundaries then,and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s people will have no sayin how the land is divided.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“Don’t say such things,”the people respond.“Don’t prophesy like that.Such disasters will never come our way!”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Should you talk that way, O family of Israel?Will the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s Spirit have patience with such behavior?If you would do what is right,you would find my words comforting.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Yet to this very hourmy people rise against me like an enemy!You steal the shirts right off the backsof those who trusted you,making them as ragged as menreturning from battle.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>You have evicted women from their pleasant homesand forever stripped their children of all that God would give them.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Up! Begone!This is no longer your land and home,for you have filled it with sinand ruined it completely.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Suppose a prophet full of lies would say to you,“I’ll preach to you the joys of wine and alcohol!”That’s just the kind of prophet you would like!",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>“Someday, O Israel, I will gather you;I will gather the remnant who are left.I will bring you together again like sheep in a pen,like a flock in its pasture.Yes, your land will againbe filled with noisy crowds!",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Your leader will break outand lead you out of exile,out through the gates of the enemy cities,back to your own land.Your king will lead you;the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> himself will guide you.”"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>I said, “Listen, you leaders of Israel!You are supposed to know right from wrong,",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>but you are the very oneswho hate good and love evil.You skin my people aliveand tear the flesh from their bones.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Yes, you eat my people’s flesh,strip off their skin,and break their bones.You chop them uplike meat for the cooking pot.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then you beg the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> for help in times of trouble!Do you really expect him to answer?After all the evil you have done,he won’t even look at you!”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>This is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says:“You false prophets are leading my people astray!You promise peace for those who give you food,but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Now the night will close around you,cutting off all your visions.Darkness will cover you,putting an end to your predictions.The sun will set for you prophets,and your day will come to an end.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Then you seers will be put to shame,and you fortune-tellers will be disgraced.And you will cover your facesbecause there is no answer from God.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But as for me, I am filled with power—with the Spirit of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.I am filled with justice and strengthto boldly declare Israel’s sin and rebellion.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Listen to me, you leaders of Israel!You hate justice and twist all that is right.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>You are building Jerusalemon a foundation of murder and corruption.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>You rulers make decisions based on bribes;you priests teach God’s laws only for a price;you prophets won’t prophesy unless you are paid.Yet all of you claim to depend on the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.“No harm can come to us,” you say,“for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is here among us.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Because of you, Mount Zion will be plowed like an open field;Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins!A thicket will grow on the heightswhere the Temple now stands."

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>In the last days, the mountain of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s housewill be the highest of all—the most important place on earth.It will be raised above the other hills,and people from all over the world will stream there to worship.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>People from many nations will come and say,“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>,to the house of Jacob’s God.There he will teach us his ways,and we will walk in his paths.”For the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s teaching will go out from Zion;his word will go out from Jerusalem.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will mediate between peoplesand will settle disputes between strong nations far away.They will hammer their swords into plowsharesand their spears into pruning hooks.Nation will no longer fight against nation,nor train for war anymore.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Everyone will live in peace and prosperity,enjoying their own grapevines and fig trees,for there will be nothing to fear.The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armieshas made this promise!",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Though the nations around us follow their idols,we will follow the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> our God forever and ever.",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Those who are weak will survive as a remnant;those who were exiles will become a strong nation.Then I, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, will rule from Jerusalemas their king forever.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>As for you, Jerusalem,the citadel of God’s people,your royal might and powerwill come back to you again.The kingship will be restoredto my precious Jerusalem.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>But why are you now screaming in terror?Have you no king to lead you?Have your wise people all died?Pain has gripped you like a woman in childbirth.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Writhe and groan like a woman in labor,you people of Jerusalem,for now you must leave this cityto live in the open country.You will soon be sent in exileto distant Babylon.But the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will rescue you there;he will redeem you from the grip of your enemies.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Now many nations have gathered against you.“Let her be desecrated,” they say.“Let us see the destruction of Jerusalem.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>But they do not know the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s thoughtsor understand his plan.These nations don’t knowthat he is gathering them togetherto be beaten and trampledlike sheaves of grain on a threshing floor.",
