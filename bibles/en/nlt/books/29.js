			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Hear this, you leaders of the people.Listen, all who live in the land.In all your history,has anything like this happened before?",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Tell your children about it in the years to come,and let your children tell their children.Pass the story down from generation to generation.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>After the cutting locusts finished eating the crops,the swarming locusts took what was left!After them came the hopping locusts,and then the stripping locusts, too!",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!Wail, all you wine-drinkers!All the grapes are ruined,and all your sweet wine is gone.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>A vast army of locusts has invaded my land,a terrible army too numerous to count.Its teeth are like lions’ teeth,its fangs like those of a lioness.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>It has destroyed my grapevinesand ruined my fig trees,stripping their bark and destroying it,leaving the branches white and bare.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Weep like a bride dressed in black,mourning the death of her husband.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>For there is no grain or wineto offer at the Temple of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.So the priests are in mourning.The ministers of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> are weeping.",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The grapevines have dried up,and the fig trees have withered.The pomegranate trees, palm trees, and apple trees—all the fruit trees—have dried up.And the people’s joy has dried up with them.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Dress yourselves in burlap and weep, you priests!Wail, you who serve before the altar!Come, spend the night in burlap,you ministers of my God.For there is no grain or wineto offer at the Temple of your God.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Announce a time of fasting;call the people together for a solemn meeting.Bring the leadersand all the people of the landinto the Temple of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God,and cry out to him there.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The day of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is near,the day when destruction comes from the Almighty.How terrible that day will be!",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Our food disappears before our very eyes.No joyful celebrations are held in the house of our God.",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, help us!The fire has consumed the wilderness pastures,and flames have burned up all the trees.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Even the wild animals cry out to youbecause the streams have dried up,and fire has consumed the wilderness pastures."

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>Sound the trumpet in Jerusalem!Raise the alarm on my holy mountain!Let everyone tremble in fearbecause the day of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is upon us.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>It is a day of darkness and gloom,a day of thick clouds and deep blackness.Suddenly, like dawn spreading across the mountains,a great and mighty army appears.Nothing like it has been seen beforeor will ever be seen again.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Fire burns in front of them,and flames follow after them.Ahead of them the land liesas beautiful as the Garden of Eden.Behind them is nothing but desolation;not one thing escapes.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>They look like horses;they charge forward like warhorses.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Look at them as they leap along the mountaintops.Listen to the noise they make—like the rumbling of chariots,like the roar of fire sweeping across a field of stubble,or like a mighty army moving into battle.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Fear grips all the people;every face grows pale with terror.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The attackers march like warriorsand scale city walls like soldiers.Straight forward they march,never breaking rank.",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The earth quakes as they advance,and the heavens tremble.The sun and moon grow dark,and the stars no longer shine.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is at the head of the column.He leads them with a shout.This is his mighty army,and they follow his orders.The day of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is an awesome, terrible thing.Who can possibly survive?",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>That is why the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> says,“Turn to me now, while there is time.Give me your hearts.Come with fasting, weeping, and mourning.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Don’t tear your clothing in your grief,but tear your hearts instead.”Return to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God,for he is merciful and compassionate,slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.He is eager to relent and not punish.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Who knows? Perhaps he will give you a reprieve,sending you a blessing instead of this curse.Perhaps you will be able to offer grain and wineto the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God as before.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Blow the ram’s horn in Jerusalem!Announce a time of fasting;call the people togetherfor a solemn meeting.",

			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Let the priests, who minister in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s presence,stand and weep between the entry room to the Temple and the altar.Let them pray, “Spare your people, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>!Don’t let your special possession become an object of mockery.Don’t let them become a joke for unbelieving foreigners who say,‘Has the God of Israel left them?’”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will pity his peopleand jealously guard the honor of his land.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will reply,“Look! I am sending you grain and new wine and olive oil,enough to satisfy your needs.You will no longer be an object of mockeryamong the surrounding nations.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>I will drive away these armies from the north.I will send them into the parched wastelands.Those in the front will be driven into the Dead Sea,and those at the rear into the Mediterranean.The stench of their rotting bodies will rise over the land.”Surely the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has done great things!",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Don’t be afraid, O land.Be glad now and rejoice,for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has done great things.",
