			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>Long ago God spoke many times and in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And now in these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance, and through the Son he created the universe.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The Son radiates God’s own glory and expresses the very character of God, and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command. When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>This shows that the Son is far greater than the angels, just as the name God gave him is greater than their names.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus:“You are my Son.Today I have become your Father.”God also said,“I will be his Father,and he will be my Son.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And when he brought his supreme Son into the world, God said,“Let all of God’s angels worship him.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Regarding the angels, he says,“He sends his angels like the winds,his servants like flames of fire.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But to the Son he says,“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever.You rule with a scepter of justice.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>You love justice and hate evil.Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you,pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>He also says to the Son,“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of the earthand made the heavens with your hands.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>They will perish, but you remain forever.They will wear out like old clothing.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>You will fold them up like a cloakand discard them like old clothing.But you are always the same;you will live forever.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>And God never said to any of the angels,“Sit in the place of honor at my right handuntil I humble your enemies,making them a footstool under your feet.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Therefore, angels are only servants—spirits sent to care for people who will inherit salvation."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>So we must listen very carefully to the truth we have heard, or we may drift away from it.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>For the message God delivered through angels has always stood firm, and every violation of the law and every act of disobedience was punished.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>So what makes us think we can escape if we ignore this great salvation that was first announced by the Lord Jesus himself and then delivered to us by those who heard him speak?",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And God confirmed the message by giving signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit whenever he chose.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And furthermore, it is not angels who will control the future world we are talking about.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>For in one place the Scriptures say, “What are mere mortals that you should think about them,or a son of man that you should care for him?",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Yet for a little while you made them a little lower than the angelsand crowned them with glory and honor.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>You gave them authority over all things.”Now when it says “all things,” it means nothing is left out. But we have not yet seen all things put under their authority.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>What we do see is Jesus, who for a little while was given a position “a little lower than the angels”; and because he suffered death for us, he is now “crowned with glory and honor.” Yes, by God’s grace, Jesus tasted death for everyone.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>God, for whom and through whom everything was made, chose to bring many children into glory. And it was only right that he should make Jesus, through his suffering, a perfect leader, fit to bring them into their salvation.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So now Jesus and the ones he makes holy have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>For he said to God,“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters.I will praise you among your assembled people.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>He also said,“I will put my trust in him,”that is, “I and the children God has given me.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Because God’s children are human beings—made of flesh and blood—the Son also became flesh and blood. For only as a human being could he die, and only by dying could he break the power of the devil, who had the power of death.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Only in this way could he set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>We also know that the Son did not come to help angels; he came to help the descendants of Abraham.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Therefore, it was necessary for him to be made in every respect like us, his brothers and sisters, so that he could be our merciful and faithful High Priest before God. Then he could offer a sacrifice that would take away the sins of the people.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Since he himself has gone through suffering and testing, he is able to help us when we are being tested."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>And so, dear brothers and sisters who belong to God and are partners with those called to heaven, think carefully about this Jesus whom we declare to be God’s messenger and High Priest.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>For he was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses served faithfully when he was entrusted with God’s entire house.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>But Jesus deserves far more glory than Moses, just as a person who builds a house deserves more praise than the house itself.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>For every house has a builder, but the one who built everything is God.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Moses was certainly faithful in God’s house as a servant. His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>But Christ, as the Son, is in charge of God’s entire house. And we are God’s house, if we keep our courage and remain confident in our hope in Christ.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>That is why the Holy Spirit says,“Today when you hear his voice,",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>don’t harden your heartsas Israel did when they rebelled,when they tested me in the wilderness.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>There your ancestors tested and tried my patience,even though they saw my miracles for forty years.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So I was angry with them, and I said,‘Their hearts always turn away from me.They refuse to do what I tell them.’",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So in my anger I took an oath:‘They will never enter my place of rest.’”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters. Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving, turning you away from the living God.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>You must warn each other every day, while it is still “today,” so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Remember what it says: “Today when you hear his voice,don’t harden your heartsas Israel did when they rebelled.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And who was it who rebelled against God, even though they heard his voice? Wasn’t it the people Moses led out of Egypt?",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And who made God angry for forty years? Wasn’t it the people who sinned, whose corpses lay in the wilderness?",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>And to whom was God speaking when he took an oath that they would never enter his rest? Wasn’t it the people who disobeyed him?",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>So we see that because of their unbelief they were not able to enter his rest."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>God’s promise of entering his rest still stands, so we ought to tremble with fear that some of you might fail to experience it.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>For this good news—that God has prepared this rest—has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it did them no good because they didn’t share the faith of those who listened to God.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said, “In my anger I took an oath:‘They will never enter my place of rest,’”even though this rest has been ready since he made the world.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>We know it is ready because of the place in the Scriptures where it mentions the seventh day: “On the seventh day God rested from all his work.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>But in the other passage God said, “They will never enter my place of rest.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>So God’s rest is there for people to enter, but those who first heard this good news failed to enter because they disobeyed God.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>So God set another time for entering his rest, and that time is today. God announced this through David much later in the words already quoted: “Today when you hear his voice,don’t harden your hearts.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Now if Joshua had succeeded in giving them this rest, God would not have spoken about another day of rest still to come.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>So there is a special rest still waiting for the people of God.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>For all who have entered into God’s rest have rested from their labors, just as God did after creating the world.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So let us do our best to enter that rest. But if we disobey God, as the people of Israel did, we will fall.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>Every high priest is a man chosen to represent other people in their dealings with God. He presents their gifts to God and offers sacrifices for their sins.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And he is able to deal gently with ignorant and wayward people because he himself is subject to the same weaknesses.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>That is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as theirs.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And no one can become a high priest simply because he wants such an honor. He must be called by God for this work, just as Aaron was.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>That is why Christ did not honor himself by assuming he could become High Priest. No, he was chosen by God, who said to him,“You are my Son.Today I have become your Father.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And in another passage God said to him,“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could rescue him from death. And God heard his prayers because of his deep reverence for God.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Even though Jesus was God’s Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>In this way, God qualified him as a perfect High Priest, and he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>And God designated him to be a High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>There is much more we would like to say about this, but it is difficult to explain, especially since you are spiritually dull and don’t seem to listen.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God’s word. You are like babies who need milk and cannot eat solid food.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For someone who lives on milk is still an infant and doesn’t know how to do what is right.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Solid food is for those who are mature, who through training have the skill to recognize the difference between right and wrong."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don’t need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds and placing our faith in God.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>You don’t need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And so, God willing, we will move forward to further understanding.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened—those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit,",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come—",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>When the ground soaks up the falling rain and bears a good crop for the farmer, it has God’s blessing.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But if a field bears thorns and thistles, it is useless. The farmer will soon condemn that field and burn it.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Dear friends, even though we are talking this way, we really don’t believe it applies to you. We are confident that you are meant for better things, things that come with salvation.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>For God is not unjust. He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers, as you still do.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Our great desire is that you will keep on loving others as long as life lasts, in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God’s promises because of their faith and endurance.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For example, there was God’s promise to Abraham. Since there was no one greater to swear by, God took an oath in his own name, saying:",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“I will certainly bless you,and I will multiply your descendants beyond number.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Then Abraham waited patiently, and he received what God had promised.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Now when people take an oath, they call on someone greater than themselves to hold them to it. And without any question that oath is binding.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>God also bound himself with an oath, so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God’s inner sanctuary.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek."
		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7 </span>This Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem and also a priest of God Most High. When Abraham was returning home after winning a great battle against the kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Then Abraham took a tenth of all he had captured in battle and gave it to Melchizedek. The name Melchizedek means “king of justice,” and king of Salem means “king of peace.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>There is no record of his father or mother or any of his ancestors—no beginning or end to his life. He remains a priest forever, resembling the Son of God.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Consider then how great this Melchizedek was. Even Abraham, the great patriarch of Israel, recognized this by giving him a tenth of what he had taken in battle.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Now the law of Moses required that the priests, who are descendants of Levi, must collect a tithe from the rest of the people of Israel, who are also descendants of Abraham.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>But Melchizedek, who was not a descendant of Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham. And Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham, the one who had already received the promises of God.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>And without question, the person who has the power to give a blessing is greater than the one who is blessed.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>The priests who collect tithes are men who die, so Melchizedek is greater than they are, because we are told that he lives on.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>In addition, we might even say that these Levites—the ones who collect the tithe—paid a tithe to Melchizedek when their ancestor Abraham paid a tithe to him.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>For although Levi wasn’t born yet, the seed from which he came was in Abraham’s body when Melchizedek collected the tithe from him.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So if the priesthood of Levi, on which the law was based, could have achieved the perfection God intended, why did God need to establish a different priesthood, with a priest in the order of Melchizedek instead of the order of Levi and Aaron?",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>And if the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed to permit it.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For the priest we are talking about belongs to a different tribe, whose members have never served at the altar as priests.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>What I mean is, our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never mentioned priests coming from that tribe.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>This change has been made very clear since a different priest, who is like Melchizedek, has appeared.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Jesus became a priest, not by meeting the physical requirement of belonging to the tribe of Levi, but by the power of a life that cannot be destroyed.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And the psalmist pointed this out when he prophesied, “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>This new system was established with a solemn oath. Aaron’s descendants became priests without such an oath,",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>but there was an oath regarding Jesus. For God said to him,“The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has taken an oath and will not break his vow:‘You are a priest forever.’”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Because of this oath, Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>There were many priests under the old system, for death prevented them from remaining in office.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people’s sins.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever."
		},
		"8": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">8 </span>Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle, the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices, our High Priest must make an offering, too.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>If he were here on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>They serve in a system of worship that is only a copy, a shadow of the real one in heaven. For when Moses was getting ready to build the Tabernacle, God gave him this warning: “Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But when God found fault with the people, he said:“The day is coming, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>,when I will make a new covenantwith the people of Israel and Judah.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>This covenant will not be like the oneI made with their ancestorswhen I took them by the handand led them out of the land of Egypt.They did not remain faithful to my covenant,so I turned my back on them, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But this is the new covenant I will makewith the people of Israel on that day, says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>:I will put my laws in their minds,and I will write them on their hearts.I will be their God,and they will be my people.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And they will not need to teach their neighbors,nor will they need to teach their relatives,saying, ‘You should know the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.’For everyone, from the least to the greatest,will know me already.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>And I will forgive their wickedness,and I will never again remember their sins.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>When God speaks of a “new” covenant, it means he has made the first one obsolete. It is now out of date and will soon disappear."
		},
		"9": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">9 </span>That first covenant between God and Israel had regulations for worship and a place of worship here on earth.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>There were two rooms in that Tabernacle. In the first room were a lampstand, a table, and sacred loaves of bread on the table. This room was called the Holy Place.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Then there was a curtain, and behind the curtain was the second room called the Most Holy Place.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>In that room were a gold incense altar and a wooden chest called the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered with gold on all sides. Inside the Ark were a gold jar containing manna, Aaron’s staff that sprouted leaves, and the stone tablets of the covenant.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Above the Ark were the cherubim of divine glory, whose wings stretched out over the Ark’s cover, the place of atonement. But we cannot explain these things in detail now.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room as they performed their religious duties.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle and the system it represented were still in use.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies—physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So Christ has now become the High Priest over all the good things that have come. He has entered that greater, more perfect Tabernacle in heaven, which was not made by human hands and is not part of this created world.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>With his own blood—not the blood of goats and calves—he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Under the old system, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer could cleanse people’s bodies from ceremonial impurity.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our consciences from sinful deeds so that we can worship the living God. For by the power of the eternal Spirit, Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>That is why he is the one who mediates a new covenant between God and people, so that all who are called can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Now when someone leaves a will, it is necessary to prove that the person who made it is dead.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The will goes into effect only after the person’s death. While the person who made it is still alive, the will cannot be put into effect.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>For after Moses had read each of God’s commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God’s law and all the people, using hyssop branches and scarlet wool.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Then he said, “This blood confirms the covenant God has made with you.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship.",

			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>so also Christ was offered once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him."

			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>There is only the terrible expectation of God’s judgment and the raging fire that will consume his enemies.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>For anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.",

			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>For we know the one who said,“I will take revenge.I will pay them back.”He also said,“The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will judge his own people.”",
