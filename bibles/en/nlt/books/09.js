			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah in the region of Zuph in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, of Ephraim.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Each year Elkanah would travel to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies at the Tabernacle. The priests of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> at that time were the two sons of Eli—Hophni and Phinehas.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>On the days Elkanah presented his sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to Peninnah and each of her children.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And though he loved Hannah, he would give her only one choice portion because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had given her no children.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>So Peninnah would taunt Hannah and make fun of her because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had kept her from having children.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Year after year it was the same—Peninnah would taunt Hannah as they went to the Tabernacle. Each time, Hannah would be reduced to tears and would not even eat.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“Why are you crying, Hannah?” Elkanah would ask. “Why aren’t you eating? Why be downhearted just because you have no children? You have me—isn’t that better than having ten sons?”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Once after a sacrificial meal at Shiloh, Hannah got up and went to pray. Eli the priest was sitting at his customary place beside the entrance of the Tabernacle.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Hannah was in deep anguish, crying bitterly as she prayed to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And she made this vow: “O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, if you will look upon my sorrow and answer my prayer and give me a son, then I will give him back to you. He will be yours for his entire lifetime, and as a sign that he has been dedicated to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, his hair will never be cut.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>As she was praying to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, Eli watched her.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Seeing her lips moving but hearing no sound, he thought she had been drinking.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“Must you come here drunk?” he demanded. “Throw away your wine!”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“Oh no, sir!” she replied. “I haven’t been drinking wine or anything stronger. But I am very discouraged, and I was pouring out my heart to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Don’t think I am a wicked woman! For I have been praying out of great anguish and sorrow.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“In that case,” Eli said, “go in peace! May the God of Israel grant the request you have asked of him.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>“Oh, thank you, sir!” she exclaimed. Then she went back and began to eat again, and she was no longer sad.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The entire family got up early the next morning and went to worship the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> once more. Then they returned home to Ramah. When Elkanah slept with Hannah, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> remembered her plea,",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>and in due time she gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, “I asked the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> for him.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>The next year Elkanah and his family went on their annual trip to offer a sacrifice to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and to keep his vow.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But Hannah did not go. She told her husband, “Wait until the boy is weaned. Then I will take him to the Tabernacle and leave him there with the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> permanently.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>“Whatever you think is best,” Elkanah agreed. “Stay here for now, and may the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> help you keep your promise.” So she stayed home and nursed the boy until he was weaned.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>When the child was weaned, Hannah took him to the Tabernacle in Shiloh. They brought along a three-year-old bull for the sacrifice and a basket of flour and some wine.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>After sacrificing the bull, they brought the boy to Eli.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>“Sir, do you remember me?” Hannah asked. “I am the very woman who stood here several years ago praying to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>I asked the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> to give me this boy, and he has granted my request.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Now I am giving him to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and he will belong to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> his whole life.” And they worshiped the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> there."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>Then Hannah prayed:“My heart rejoices in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>!The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has made me strong.Now I have an answer for my enemies;I rejoice because you rescued me.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>No one is holy like the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>!There is no one besides you;there is no Rock like our God.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>“Stop acting so proud and haughty!Don’t speak with such arrogance!For the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is a God who knows what you have done;he will judge your actions.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>The bow of the mighty is now broken,and those who stumbled are now strong.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Those who were well fed are now starving,and those who were starving are now full.The childless woman now has seven children,and the woman with many children wastes away.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gives both death and life;he brings some down to the grave but raises others up.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> makes some poor and others rich;he brings some down and lifts others up.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>He lifts the poor from the dustand the needy from the garbage dump.He sets them among princes,placing them in seats of honor.For all the earth is the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s,and he has set the world in order.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“He will protect his faithful ones,but the wicked will disappear in darkness.No one will succeed by strength alone.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Those who fight against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will be shattered.He thunders against them from heaven;the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> judges throughout the earth.He gives power to his king;he increases the strength of his anointed one.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then Elkanah returned home to Ramah without Samuel. And the boy served the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> by assisting Eli the priest.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels who had no respect for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>or for their duties as priests. Whenever anyone offered a sacrifice, Eli’s sons would send over a servant with a three-pronged fork. While the meat of the sacrificed animal was still boiling,",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>the servant would stick the fork into the pot and demand that whatever it brought up be given to Eli’s sons. All the Israelites who came to worship at Shiloh were treated this way.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Sometimes the servant would come even before the animal’s fat had been burned on the altar. He would demand raw meat before it had been boiled so that it could be used for roasting.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>The man offering the sacrifice might reply, “Take as much as you want, but the fat must be burned first.” Then the servant would demand, “No, give it to me now, or I’ll take it by force.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>So the sin of these young men was very serious in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s sight, for they treated the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s offerings with contempt.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>But Samuel, though he was only a boy, served the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. He wore a linen garment like that of a priest.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Each year his mother made a small coat for him and brought it to him when she came with her husband for the sacrifice.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Before they returned home, Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> give you other children to take the place of this one she gave to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> blessed Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, Samuel grew up in the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Now Eli was very old, but he was aware of what his sons were doing to the people of Israel. He knew, for instance, that his sons were seducing the young women who assisted at the entrance of the Tabernacle.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Eli said to them, “I have been hearing reports from all the people about the wicked things you are doing. Why do you keep sinning?",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>You must stop, my sons! The reports I hear among the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s people are not good.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>If someone sins against another person, God can mediate for the guilty party. But if someone sins against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, who can intercede?” But Eli’s sons wouldn’t listen to their father, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was already planning to put them to death.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew taller and grew in favor with the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and with the people.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>One day a man of God came to Eli and gave him this message from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: “I revealed myself to your ancestors when they were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>I chose your ancestor Aaron from among all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer sacrifices on my altar, to burn incense, and to wear the priestly vest as he served me. And I assigned the sacrificial offerings to you priests.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>So why do you scorn my sacrifices and offerings? Why do you give your sons more honor than you give me—for you and they have become fat from the best offerings of my people Israel!",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>“Therefore, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: I promised that your branch of the tribe of Levi would always be my priests. But I will honor those who honor me, and I will despise those who think lightly of me.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>The time is coming when I will put an end to your family, so it will no longer serve as my priests. All the members of your family will die before their time. None will reach old age.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>You will watch with envy as I pour out prosperity on the people of Israel. But no members of your family will ever live out their days.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>The few not cut off from serving at my altar will survive, but only so their eyes can go blind and their hearts break, and their children will die a violent death.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>And to prove that what I have said will come true, I will cause your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, to die on the same day!",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>“Then I will raise up a faithful priest who will serve me and do what I desire. I will establish his family, and they will be priests to my anointed kings forever.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Then all of your surviving family will bow before him, begging for money and food. ‘Please,’ they will say, ‘give us jobs among the priests so we will have enough to eat.’”"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>Meanwhile, the boy Samuel served the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> by assisting Eli. Now in those days messages from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> were very rare, and visions were quite uncommon.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>One night Eli, who was almost blind by now, had gone to bed.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was sleeping in the Tabernacle near the Ark of God.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Suddenly the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> called out, “Samuel!”“Yes?” Samuel replied. “What is it?”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>He got up and ran to Eli. “Here I am. Did you call me?”“I didn’t call you,” Eli replied. “Go back to bed.” So he did.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> called out again, “Samuel!”Again Samuel got up and went to Eli. “Here I am. Did you call me?”“I didn’t call you, my son,” Eli said. “Go back to bed.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Samuel did not yet know the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> because he had never had a message from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> before.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> called a third time, and once more Samuel got up and went to Eli. “Here I am. Did you call me?”Then Eli realized it was the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> who was calling the boy.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>So he said to Samuel, “Go and lie down again, and if someone calls again, say, ‘Speak, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went back to bed.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> came and called as before, “Samuel! Samuel!”And Samuel replied, “Speak, your servant is listening.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “I am about to do a shocking thing in Israel.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>I am going to carry out all my threats against Eli and his family, from beginning to end.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>I have warned him that judgment is coming upon his family forever, because his sons are blaspheming God and he hasn’t disciplined them.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>So I have vowed that the sins of Eli and his sons will never be forgiven by sacrifices or offerings.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Samuel stayed in bed until morning, then got up and opened the doors of the Tabernacle as usual. He was afraid to tell Eli what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had said to him.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But Eli called out to him, “Samuel, my son.”“Here I am,” Samuel replied.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“What did the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> say to you? Tell me everything. And may God strike you and even kill you if you hide anything from me!”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>So Samuel told Eli everything; he didn’t hold anything back. “It is the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s will,” Eli replied. “Let him do what he thinks best.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>As Samuel grew up, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was with him, and everything Samuel said proved to be reliable.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>And all Israel, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> continued to appear at Shiloh and gave messages to Samuel there at the Tabernacle."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum mid-paragraph\">4 </span><sup class=\"versenum mid-paragraph\">1 </sup>And Samuel’s words went out to all the people of Israel.At that time Israel was at war with the Philistines. The Israelite army was camped near Ebenezer, and the Philistines were at Aphek.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The Philistines attacked and defeated the army of Israel, killing 4,000 men.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>After the battle was over, the troops retreated to their camp, and the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> allow us to be defeated by the Philistines?” Then they said, “Let’s bring the Ark of the Covenant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> from Shiloh. If we carry it into battle with us, it will save us from our enemies.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>So they sent men to Shiloh to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, who is enthroned between the cherubim. Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were also there with the Ark of the Covenant of God.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>When all the Israelites saw the Ark of the Covenant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> coming into the camp, their shout of joy was so loud it made the ground shake!",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“What’s going on?” the Philistines asked. “What’s all the shouting about in the Hebrew camp?” When they were told it was because the Ark of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had arrived,",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>they panicked. “The gods have come into their camp!” they cried. “This is a disaster! We have never had to face anything like this before!",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Help! Who can save us from these mighty gods of Israel? They are the same gods who destroyed the Egyptians with plagues when Israel was in the wilderness.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Fight as never before, Philistines! If you don’t, we will become the Hebrews’ slaves just as they have been ours! Stand up like men and fight!”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So the Philistines fought desperately, and Israel was defeated again. The slaughter was great; 30,000 Israelite soldiers died that day. The survivors turned and fled to their tents.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The Ark of God was captured, and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were killed.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefield and arrived at Shiloh later that same day. He had torn his clothes and put dust on his head to show his grief.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Eli was waiting beside the road to hear the news of the battle, for his heart trembled for the safety of the Ark of God. When the messenger arrived and told what had happened, an outcry resounded throughout the town.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“What is all the noise about?” Eli asked.The messenger rushed over to Eli,",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>who was ninety-eight years old and blind.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>He said to Eli, “I have just come from the battlefield—I was there this very day.”“What happened, my son?” Eli demanded.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“Israel has been defeated by the Philistines,” the messenger replied. “The people have been slaughtered, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were also killed. And the Ark of God has been captured.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>When the messenger mentioned what had happened to the Ark of God, Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate. He broke his neck and died, for he was old and overweight. He had been Israel’s judge for forty years.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near her time of delivery. When she heard that the Ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>She died in childbirth, but before she passed away the midwives tried to encourage her. “Don’t be afraid,” they said. “You have a baby boy!” But she did not answer or pay attention to them.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>She named the child Ichabod (which means “Where is the glory?”), for she said, “Israel’s glory is gone.” She named him this because the Ark of God had been captured and because her father-in-law and husband were dead.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Then she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the Ark of God has been captured.”"
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>After the Philistines captured the Ark of God, they took it from the battleground at Ebenezer to the town of Ashdod.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>They carried the Ark of God into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside an idol of Dagon.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>But when the citizens of Ashdod went to see it the next morning, Dagon had fallen with his face to the ground in front of the Ark of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>! So they took Dagon and put him in his place again.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>But the next morning the same thing happened—Dagon had fallen face down before the Ark of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> again. This time his head and hands had broken off and were lying in the doorway. Only the trunk of his body was left intact.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor anyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod will step on its threshold.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s heavy hand struck the people of Ashdod and the nearby villages with a plague of tumors.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>When the people realized what was happening, they cried out, “We can’t keep the Ark of the God of Israel here any longer! He is against us! We will all be destroyed along with Dagon, our god.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>So they called together the rulers of the Philistine towns and asked, “What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?”The rulers discussed it and replied, “Move it to the town of Gath.” So they moved the Ark of the God of Israel to Gath.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>But when the Ark arrived at Gath, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s heavy hand fell on its men, young and old; he struck them with a plague of tumors, and there was a great panic.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So they sent the Ark of God to the town of Ekron, but when the people of Ekron saw it coming they cried out, “They are bringing the Ark of the God of Israel here to kill us, too!”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The people summoned the Philistine rulers again and begged them, “Please send the Ark of the God of Israel back to its own country, or it will kill us all.” For the deadly plague from God had already begun, and great fear was sweeping across the town.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Those who didn’t die were afflicted with tumors; and the cry from the town rose to heaven."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>The Ark of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> remained in Philistine territory seven months in all.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Then the Philistines called in their priests and diviners and asked them, “What should we do about the Ark of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>? Tell us how to return it to its own country.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>“Send the Ark of the God of Israel back with a gift,” they were told. “Send a guilt offering so the plague will stop. Then, if you are healed, you will know it was his hand that caused the plague.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“What sort of guilt offering should we send?” they asked.And they were told, “Since the plague has struck both you and your five rulers, make five gold tumors and five gold rats, just like those that have ravaged your land.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Make these things to show honor to the God of Israel. Perhaps then he will stop afflicting you, your gods, and your land.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Don’t be stubborn and rebellious as Pharaoh and the Egyptians were. By the time God was finished with them, they were eager to let Israel go.",

I have rejected him as king of Israel, so fill your flask with olive oil and go to Bethlehem. Find a man named Jesse who lives there, for I have selected one of his sons to be my king.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>But Samuel asked, “How can I do that? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.”“Take a heifer with you,” the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> replied, “and say that you have come to make a sacrifice to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",

			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“Yes,” Samuel replied. “I have come to sacrifice to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. Purify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then Samuel performed the purification rite for Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice, too.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, “Surely this is the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s anointed!”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>But the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Don’t judge by his appearance or height, for I have rejected him. The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> doesn’t see things the way you see them. People judge by outward appearance, but the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> looks at the heart.”",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Next Jesse summoned Shimea, but Samuel said, “Neither is this the one the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has chosen.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>In the same way all seven of Jesse’s sons were presented to Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has not chosen any of these.”",

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>So as David stood there among his brothers, Samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and anointed David with the oil. And the Spirit of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> came powerfully upon David from that day on. Then Samuel returned to Ramah.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Now the Spirit of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had left Saul, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> sent a tormenting spirit that filled him with depression and fear.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Some of Saul’s servants said to him, “A tormenting spirit from God is troubling you.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Let us find a good musician to play the harp whenever the tormenting spirit troubles you. He will play soothing music, and you will soon be well again.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“All right,” Saul said. “Find me someone who plays well, and bring him here.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>One of the servants said to Saul, “One of Jesse’s sons from Bethlehem is a talented harp player.

			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>So David went to Saul and began serving him. Saul loved David very much, and David became his armor bearer.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Then Saul sent word to Jesse asking, “Please let David remain in my service, for I am very pleased with him.”",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Then Jonathan told David, “I promise by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, that by this time tomorrow, or the next day at the latest, I will talk to my father and let you know at once how he feels about you. If he speaks favorably about you, I will let you know.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But if he is angry and wants you killed, may the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> strike me and even kill me if I don’t warn you so you can escape and live. May the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> be with you as he used to be with my father.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And may you treat me with the faithful love of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> as long as I live. But if I die,",

			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So Jonathan made a solemn pact with David, saying, “May the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> destroy all your enemies!”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And Jonathan made David reaffirm his vow of friendship again, for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Then Jonathan said, “Tomorrow we celebrate the new moon festival. You will be missed when your place at the table is empty.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid before, and wait there by the stone pile.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>I will come out and shoot three arrows to the side of the stone pile as though I were shooting at a target.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back. If you hear me tell him, ‘They’re on this side,’ then you will know, as surely as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> lives, that all is well, and there is no trouble.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But if I tell him, ‘Go farther—the arrows are still ahead of you,’ then it will mean that you must leave immediately, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is sending you away.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>And may the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> make us keep our promises to each other, for he has witnessed them.”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>So David hid himself in the field, and when the new moon festival began, the king sat down to eat.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>He sat at his usual place against the wall, with Jonathan sitting opposite him and Abner beside him. But David’s place was empty.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Saul didn’t say anything about it that day, for he said to himself, “Something must have made David ceremonially unclean.”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>But when David’s place was empty again the next day, Saul asked Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse been here for the meal either yesterday or today?”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Jonathan replied, “David earnestly asked me if he could go to Bethlehem.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>He said, ‘Please let me go, for we are having a family sacrifice. My brother demanded that I be there. So please let me get away to see my brothers.’ That’s why he isn’t here at the king’s table.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>Saul boiled with rage at Jonathan. “You stupid son of a whore!” he swore at him. “Do you think I don’t know that you want him to be king in your place, shaming yourself and your mother?",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>As long as that son of Jesse is alive, you’ll never be king. Now go and get him so I can kill him!”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>“But why should he be put to death?” Jonathan asked his father. “What has he done?”",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan, intending to kill him. So at last Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Jonathan left the table in fierce anger and refused to eat on that second day of the festival, for he was crushed by his father’s shameful behavior toward David.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>The next morning, as agreed, Jonathan went out into the field and took a young boy with him to gather his arrows.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>“Start running,” he told the boy, “so you can find the arrows as I shoot them.” So the boy ran, and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>When the boy had almost reached the arrow, Jonathan shouted, “The arrow is still ahead of you.",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Hurry, hurry, don’t wait.” So the boy quickly gathered up the arrows and ran back to his master.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>He, of course, suspected nothing; only Jonathan and David understood the signal.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>Then Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him to take them back to town.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>As soon as the boy was gone, David came out from where he had been hiding near the stone pile. Then David bowed three times to Jonathan with his face to the ground. Both of them were in tears as they embraced each other and said good-bye, especially David.",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>At last Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for we have sworn loyalty to each other in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s name. The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is the witness of a bond between us and our children forever.” Then David left, and Jonathan returned to the town."

It had just been replaced that day with fresh bread.",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“I only have the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah,” the priest replied. “It is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. Take that if you want it, for there is nothing else here.”“There is nothing like it!” David replied. “Give it to me!”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So David escaped from Saul and went to King Achish of Gath.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But the officers of Achish were unhappy about his being there. “Isn’t this David, the king of the land?” they asked. “Isn’t he the one the people honor with dances, singing,‘Saul has killed his thousands,and David his ten thousands’?”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>David heard these comments and was very afraid of what King Achish of Gath might do to him.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>So he pretended to be insane, scratching on doors and drooling down his beard.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Finally, King Achish said to his men, “Must you bring me a madman?",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing there with Saul’s men, spoke up. “When I was at Nob,” he said, “I saw the son of Jesse talking to the priest, Ahimelech son of Ahitub.",

For they have driven me from my home, so I can no longer live among the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s people, and they have said, ‘Go, worship pagan gods.’",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>No one was left alive to come to Gath and tell where he had really been. This happened again and again while he was living among the Philistines.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Achish believed David and thought to himself, “By now the people of Israel must hate him bitterly. Now he will have to stay here and serve me forever!”"
		},
		"28": {

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Saul then said to his advisers, “Find a woman who is a medium, so I can go and ask her what to do.”His advisers replied, “There is a medium at Endor.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>So Saul disguised himself by wearing ordinary clothing instead of his royal robes. Then he went to the woman’s home at night, accompanied by two of his men.“I have to talk to a man who has died,” he said. “Will you call up his spirit for me?”",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But Saul took an oath in the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and promised, “As surely as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> lives, nothing bad will happen to you for doing this.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Finally, the woman said, “Well, whose spirit do you want me to call up?”“Call up Samuel,” Saul replied.",

So I have called for you to tell me what to do.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But Samuel replied, “Why ask me, since the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has left you and has become your enemy?",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has done just as he said he would. He has torn the kingdom from you and given it to your rival, David.",

			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>When the woman saw how distraught he was, she said, “Sir, I obeyed your command at the risk of my life.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Now do what I say, and let me give you a little something to eat so you can regain your strength for the trip back.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But Saul refused to eat anything. Then his advisers joined the woman in urging him to eat, so he finally yielded and got up from the ground and sat on the couch.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>The woman had been fattening a calf, so she hurried out and killed it. She took some flour, kneaded it into dough and baked unleavened bread.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>She brought the meal to Saul and his advisers, and they ate it. Then they went out into the night."

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>But the Philistine commanders demanded, “What are these Hebrews doing here?”And Achish told them, “This is David, the servant of King Saul of Israel. He’s been with me for years, and I’ve never found a single fault in him from the day he arrived until today.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>But the Philistine commanders were angry. “Send him back to the town you’ve given him!” they demanded. “He can’t go into the battle with us. What if he turns against us in battle and becomes our adversary? Is there any better way for him to reconcile himself with his master than by handing our heads over to him?",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Isn’t this the same David about whom the women of Israel sing in their dances, ‘Saul has killed his thousands,and David his ten thousands’?”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>So Achish finally summoned David and said to him, “I swear by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> that you have been a trustworthy ally. I think you should go with me into battle, for I’ve never found a single flaw in you from the day you arrived until today. But the other Philistine rulers won’t hear of it.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Please don’t upset them, but go back quietly.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“What have I done to deserve this treatment?” David demanded. “What have you ever found in your servant, that I can’t go and fight the enemies of my lord the king?”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>But Achish insisted, “As far as I’m concerned, you’re as perfect as an angel of God. But the Philistine commanders are afraid to have you with them in the battle.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Now get up early in the morning, and leave with your men as soon as it gets light.”",
