			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>I am writing to remind you, dear friends, that we should love one another. This is not a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Love means doing what God has commanded us, and he has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny that Jesus Christ came in a real body. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist.",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>I have much more to say to you, but I don’t want to do it with paper and ink. For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our joy will be complete.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Greetings from the children of your sister, chosen by God."
