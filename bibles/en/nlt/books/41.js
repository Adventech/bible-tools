			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God. It began",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>just as the prophet Isaiah had written:“Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,and he will prepare your way.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>He is a voice shouting in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s coming!Clear the road for him!’”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>This messenger was John the Baptist. He was in the wilderness and preached that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>All of Judea, including all the people of Jerusalem, went out to see and hear John. And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>His clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>John announced: “Someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit!”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>One day Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan River.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And a voice from heaven said, “You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The Spirit then compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness,",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>where he was tempted by Satan for forty days. He was out among the wild animals, and angels took care of him.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Later on, after John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, where he preached God’s Good News.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“The time promised by God has come at last!”</span> he announced. <span class=\"woj\">“The Kingdom of God is near! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News!”</span>",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the water, for they fished for a living.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Jesus called out to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!”</span>",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>And they left their nets at once and followed him.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>A little farther up the shore Jesus saw Zebedee’s sons, James and John, in a boat repairing their nets.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>He called them at once, and they also followed him, leaving their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired men.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Jesus and his companions went to the town of Capernaum. When the Sabbath day came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught with real authority—quite unlike the teachers of religious law.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Suddenly, a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>“Why are you interfering with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>But Jesus reprimanded him. <span class=\"woj\">“Be quiet! Come out of the man,”</span> he ordered.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>At that, the evil spirit screamed, threw the man into a convulsion, and then came out of him.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Amazement gripped the audience, and they began to discuss what had happened. “What sort of new teaching is this?” they asked excitedly. “It has such authority! Even evil spirits obey his orders!”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout the entire region of Galilee.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>After Jesus left the synagogue with James and John, they went to Simon and Andrew’s home.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>Now Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever. They told Jesus about her right away.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>So he went to her bedside, took her by the hand, and helped her sit up. Then the fever left her, and she prepared a meal for them.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>That evening after sunset, many sick and demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>The whole town gathered at the door to watch.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>So Jesus healed many people who were sick with various diseases, and he cast out many demons. But because the demons knew who he was, he did not allow them to speak.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Later Simon and the others went out to find him.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you.”",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>But Jesus replied, <span class=\"woj\">“We must go on to other towns as well, and I will preach to them, too. That is why I came.”</span>",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>So he traveled throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and casting out demons.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>A man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus, begging to be healed. “If you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean,” he said.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out and touched him. <span class=\"woj\">“I am willing,”</span> he said. <span class=\"woj\">“Be healed!”</span>",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>Instantly the leprosy disappeared, and the man was healed.",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>Then Jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning:",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“Don’t tell anyone about this. Instead, go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed.”</span>",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>But the man went and spread the word, proclaiming to everyone what had happened. As a result, large crowds soon surrounded Jesus, and he couldn’t publicly enter a town anywhere. He had to stay out in the secluded places, but people from everywhere kept coming to him."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>When Jesus returned to Capernaum several days later, the news spread quickly that he was back home.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there was no more room, even outside the door. While he was preaching God’s word to them,",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>They couldn’t bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they dug a hole through the roof above his head. Then they lowered the man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, <span class=\"woj\">“My child, your sins are forgiven.”</span>",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves,",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>“What is he saying? This is blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking, so he asked them, <span class=\"woj\">“Why do you question this in your hearts?</span>",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or ‘Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk’?</span>",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup><span class=\"woj\">So I will prove to you that the Son of Man has the authority on earth to forgive sins.”</span> Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said,",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!”</span>",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>And the man jumped up, grabbed his mat, and walked out through the stunned onlookers. They were all amazed and praised God, exclaiming, “We’ve never seen anything like this before!”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then Jesus went out to the lakeshore again and taught the crowds that were coming to him.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at his tax collector’s booth. <span class=\"woj\">“Follow me and be my disciple,”</span> Jesus said to him. So Levi got up and followed him.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Later, Levi invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests, along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners. (There were many people of this kind among Jesus’ followers.)",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But when the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees saw him eating with tax collectors and other sinners, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with such scum?”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>When Jesus heard this, he told them, <span class=\"woj\">“Healthy people don’t need a doctor—sick people do. I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners.”</span>",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Once when John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, some people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t your disciples fast like John’s disciples and the Pharisees do?”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Jesus replied, <span class=\"woj\">“Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. They can’t fast while the groom is with them.</span>",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup><span class=\"woj\">But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</span>",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“Besides, who would patch old clothing with new cloth? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth, leaving an even bigger tear than before.</span>",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the wine would burst the wineskins, and the wine and the skins would both be lost. New wine calls for new wineskins.”</span>",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples began breaking off heads of grain to eat.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>But the Pharisees said to Jesus, “Look, why are they breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Haven’t you ever read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span>",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup><span class=\"woj\">He went into the house of God (during the days when Abiathar was high priest) and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat. He also gave some to his companions.”</span>",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath.</span>",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup><span class=\"woj\">So the Son of Man is Lord, even over the Sabbath!”</span>"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>Jesus went into the synagogue again and noticed a man with a deformed hand.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Since it was the Sabbath, Jesus’ enemies watched him closely. If he healed the man’s hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Jesus said to the man with the deformed hand, <span class=\"woj\">“Come and stand in front of everyone.”</span>",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then he turned to his critics and asked, <span class=\"woj\">“Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?”</span> But they wouldn’t answer him.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>He looked around at them angrily and was deeply saddened by their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, <span class=\"woj\">“Hold out your hand.”</span> So the man held out his hand, and it was restored!",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>At once the Pharisees went away and met with the supporters of Herod to plot how to kill Jesus.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Jesus went out to the lake with his disciples, and a large crowd followed him. They came from all over Galilee, Judea,",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Jerusalem, Idumea, from east of the Jordan River, and even from as far north as Tyre and Sidon. The news about his miracles had spread far and wide, and vast numbers of people came to see him.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Jesus instructed his disciples to have a boat ready so the crowd would not crush him.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>He had healed many people that day, so all the sick people eagerly pushed forward to touch him.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And whenever those possessed by evil spirits caught sight of him, the spirits would throw them to the ground in front of him shrieking, “You are the Son of God!”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>But Jesus sternly commanded the spirits not to reveal who he was.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Afterward Jesus went up on a mountain and called out the ones he wanted to go with him. And they came to him.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then he appointed twelve of them and called them his apostles. They were to accompany him, and he would send them out to preach,",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>giving them authority to cast out demons.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>These are the twelve he chose:Simon (whom he named Peter),",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>James and John (the sons of Zebedee, but Jesus nicknamed them “Sons of Thunder”),",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Andrew,Philip,Bartholomew,Matthew,Thomas,James (son of Alphaeus),Thaddaeus,Simon (the zealot),",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>One time Jesus entered a house, and the crowds began to gather again. Soon he and his disciples couldn’t even find time to eat.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>When his family heard what was happening, they tried to take him away. “He’s out of his mind,” they said.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But the teachers of religious law who had arrived from Jerusalem said, “He’s possessed by Satan, the prince of demons. That’s where he gets the power to cast out demons.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Jesus called them over and responded with an illustration. <span class=\"woj\">“How can Satan cast out Satan?”</span> he asked.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“A kingdom divided by civil war will collapse.</span>",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Similarly, a family splintered by feuding will fall apart.</span>",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup><span class=\"woj\">And if Satan is divided and fights against himself, how can he stand? He would never survive.</span>",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Let me illustrate this further. Who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods? Only someone even stronger—someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house.</span>",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“I tell you the truth, all sin and blasphemy can be forgiven,</span>",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup><span class=\"woj\">but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. This is a sin with eternal consequences.”</span>",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>He told them this because they were saying, “He’s possessed by an evil spirit.”",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him. They stood outside and sent word for him to come out and talk with them.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and someone said, “Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Jesus replied, <span class=\"woj\">“Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”</span>",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Then he looked at those around him and said, <span class=\"woj\">“Look, these are my mother and brothers.</span>",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Anyone who does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”</span>"
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>Once again Jesus began teaching by the lakeshore. A very large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat in the boat while all the people remained on the shore.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>He taught them by telling many stories in the form of parables, such as this one:",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seed.</span>",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup><span class=\"woj\">As he scattered it across his field, some of the seed fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate it.</span>",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Other seed fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seed sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.</span>",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup><span class=\"woj\">But the plant soon wilted under the hot sun, and since it didn’t have deep roots, it died.</span>",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Other seed fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants so they produced no grain.</span>",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they sprouted, grew, and produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”</span>",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then he said, <span class=\"woj\">“Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.”</span>",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Later, when Jesus was alone with the twelve disciples and with the others who were gathered around, they asked him what the parables meant.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>He replied, <span class=\"woj\">“You are permitted to understand the secret of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables for everything I say to outsiders,</span>",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup><span class=\"woj\">so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled:</span><span class=\"woj\">‘When they see what I do,</span><span class=\"woj\">they will learn nothing.</span><span class=\"woj\">When they hear what I say,</span><span class=\"woj\">they will not understand.</span><span class=\"woj\">Otherwise, they will turn to me</span><span class=\"woj\">and be forgiven.’”</span>",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“If you can’t understand the meaning of this parable, how will you understand all the other parables?</span>",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup><span class=\"woj\">The farmer plants seed by taking God’s word to others.</span>",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup><span class=\"woj\">The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message, only to have Satan come at once and take it away.</span>",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup><span class=\"woj\">The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.</span>",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup><span class=\"woj\">But since they don’t have deep roots, they don’t last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God’s word.</span>",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup><span class=\"woj\">The seed that fell among the thorns represents others who hear God’s word,</span>",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup><span class=\"woj\">but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and the desire for other things, so no fruit is produced.</span>",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup><span class=\"woj\">And the seed that fell on good soil represents those who hear and accept God’s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”</span>",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Then Jesus asked them, <span class=\"woj\">“Would anyone light a lamp and then put it under a basket or under a bed? Of course not! A lamp is placed on a stand, where its light will shine.</span>",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup><span class=\"woj\">For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.</span>",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.”</span>",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Then he added, <span class=\"woj\">“Pay close attention to what you hear. The closer you listen, the more understanding you will be given—and you will receive even more.</span>",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup><span class=\"woj\">To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them.”</span>",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Jesus also said, <span class=\"woj\">“The Kingdom of God is like a farmer who scatters seed on the ground.</span>",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Night and day, while he’s asleep or awake, the seed sprouts and grows, but he does not understand how it happens.</span>",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup><span class=\"woj\">The earth produces the crops on its own. First a leaf blade pushes through, then the heads of wheat are formed, and finally the grain ripens.</span>",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup><span class=\"woj\">And as soon as the grain is ready, the farmer comes and harvests it with a sickle, for the harvest time has come.”</span>",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“How can I describe the Kingdom of God? What story should I use to illustrate it?</span>",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup><span class=\"woj\">It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. It is the smallest of all seeds,</span>",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup><span class=\"woj\">but it becomes the largest of all garden plants; it grows long branches, and birds can make nests in its shade.”</span>",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Jesus used many similar stories and illustrations to teach the people as much as they could understand.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>In fact, in his public ministry he never taught without using parables; but afterward, when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>As evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, <span class=\"woj\">“Let’s cross to the other side of the lake.”</span>",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>So they took Jesus in the boat and started out, leaving the crowds behind (although other boats followed).",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>But soon a fierce storm came up. High waves were breaking into the boat, and it began to fill with water.",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Jesus was sleeping at the back of the boat with his head on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re going to drown?”",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and said to the waves, <span class=\"woj\">“Silence! Be still!”</span> Suddenly the wind stopped, and there was a great calm.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>Then he asked them, <span class=\"woj\">“Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?”</span>",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>The disciples were absolutely terrified. “Who is this man?” they asked each other. “Even the wind and waves obey him!”"
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>So they arrived at the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>When Jesus climbed out of the boat, a man possessed by an evil spirit came out from the tombs to meet him.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>This man lived in the burial caves and could no longer be restrained, even with a chain.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Whenever he was put into chains and shackles—as he often was—he snapped the chains from his wrists and smashed the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue him.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Day and night he wandered among the burial caves and in the hills, howling and cutting himself with sharp stones.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>When Jesus was still some distance away, the man saw him, ran to meet him, and bowed low before him.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>With a shriek, he screamed, “Why are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In the name of God, I beg you, don’t torture me!”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>For Jesus had already said to the spirit, <span class=\"woj\">“Come out of the man, you evil spirit.”</span>",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then Jesus demanded, <span class=\"woj\">“What is your name?”</span>And he replied, “My name is Legion, because there are many of us inside this man.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then the evil spirits begged him again and again not to send them to some distant place.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>“Send us into those pigs,” the spirits begged. “Let us enter them.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>So Jesus gave them permission. The evil spirits came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the entire herd of about 2,000 pigs plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>The herdsmen fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news as they ran. People rushed out to see what had happened.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>A crowd soon gathered around Jesus, and they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. He was sitting there fully clothed and perfectly sane, and they were all afraid.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Then those who had seen what happened told the others about the demon-possessed man and the pigs.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And the crowd began pleading with Jesus to go away and leave them alone.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon possessed begged to go with him.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>But Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“No, go home to your family, and tell them everything the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been.”</span>",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>So the man started off to visit the Ten Towns of that region and began to proclaim the great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed at what he told them.",

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Very early on Sunday morning, just at sunrise, they went to the tomb.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>On the way they were asking each other, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>But as they arrived, they looked up and saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled aside.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side. The women were shocked,",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>but the angel said, “Don’t be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He isn’t here! He is risen from the dead! Look, this is where they laid his body.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Now go and tell his disciples, including Peter, that Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you before he died.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>The women fled from the tomb, trembling and bewildered, and they said nothing to anyone because they were too frightened.Then they briefly reported all this to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out from east to west with the sacred and unfailing message of salvation that gives eternal life. Amen.",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>She went to the disciples, who were grieving and weeping, and told them what had happened.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But when she told them that Jesus was alive and she had seen him, they didn’t believe her.",
