			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And I am praying that you will put into action the generosity that comes from your faith as you understand and experience all the good things we have in Christ.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Your love has given me much joy and comfort, my brother, for your kindness has often refreshed the hearts of God’s people.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>That is why I am boldly asking a favor of you. I could demand it in the name of Christ because it is the right thing for you to do.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>But because of our love, I prefer simply to ask you. Consider this as a request from me—Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus.",

			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>It seems you lost Onesimus for a little while so that you could have him back forever.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>He is no longer like a slave to you. He is more than a slave, for he is a beloved brother, especially to me. Now he will mean much more to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.",
