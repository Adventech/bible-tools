			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>You have been deceived by your own pridebecause you live in a rock fortressand make your home high in the mountains.‘Who can ever reach us way up here?’you ask boastfully.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>But even if you soar as high as eaglesand build your nest among the stars,I will bring you crashing down,”says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“If thieves came at night and robbed you(what a disaster awaits you!),they would not take everything.Those who harvest grapesalways leave a few for the poor.But your enemies will wipe you out completely!",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>When they were invaded,you stood aloof, refusing to help them.Foreign invaders carried off their wealthand cast lots to divide up Jerusalem,but you acted like one of Israel’s enemies.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>“You should not have gloatedwhen they exiled your relatives to distant lands.You should not have rejoicedwhen the people of Judah suffered such misfortune.You should not have spoken arrogantlyin that terrible time of trouble.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>You should not have plundered the land of Israelwhen they were suffering such calamity.You should not have gloated over their destructionwhen they were suffering such calamity.You should not have seized their wealthwhen they were suffering such calamity.",
