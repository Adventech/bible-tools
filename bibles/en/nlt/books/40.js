			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. About that time some wise men from eastern lands arrived in Jerusalem, asking,",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star as it rose, and we have come to worship him.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>King Herod was deeply disturbed when he heard this, as was everyone in Jerusalem.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>He called a meeting of the leading priests and teachers of religious law and asked, “Where is the Messiah supposed to be born?”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they said, “for this is what the prophet wrote:",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>‘And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,are not least among the ruling cities of Judah,for a ruler will come from youwho will be the shepherd for my people Israel.’”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Then Herod called for a private meeting with the wise men, and he learned from them the time when the star first appeared.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Then he told them, “Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can go and worship him, too!”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>After this interview the wise men went their way. And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem. It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>When they saw the star, they were filled with joy!",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>When it was time to leave, they returned to their own country by another route, for God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>After the wise men were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up! Flee to Egypt with the child and his mother,” the angel said. “Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>That night Joseph left for Egypt with the child and Mary, his mother,",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>and they stayed there until Herod’s death. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “I called my Son out of Egypt.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Herod was furious when he realized that the wise men had outwitted him. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, based on the wise men’s report of the star’s first appearance.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Herod’s brutal action fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>“A cry was heard in Ramah—weeping and great mourning.Rachel weeps for her children,refusing to be comforted,for they are dead.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>“Get up!” the angel said. “Take the child and his mother back to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>So Joseph got up and returned to the land of Israel with Jesus and his mother.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But when he learned that the new ruler of Judea was Herod’s son Archelaus, he was afraid to go there. Then, after being warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>So the family went and lived in a town called Nazareth. This fulfilled what the prophets had said: “He will be called a Nazarene.”"

		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>In those days John the Baptist came to the Judean wilderness and began preaching. His message was,",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The prophet Isaiah was speaking about John when he said,“He is a voice shouting in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s coming!Clear the road for him!’”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>John’s clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>People from Jerusalem and from all of Judea and all over the Jordan Valley went out to see and hear John.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to watch him baptize, he denounced them. “You brood of snakes!” he exclaimed. “Who warned you to flee the coming wrath?",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Don’t just say to each other, ‘We’re safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.’ That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Even now the ax of God’s judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>“I baptize with water those who repent of their sins and turn to God. But someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not worthy even to be his slave and carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But John tried to talk him out of it. “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why are you coming to me?”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>But Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires.”</span> So John agreed to baptize him.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And a voice from heaven said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy.”"
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>During that time the devil came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>But Jesus told him, <span class=\"woj\">“No! The Scriptures say,</span><span class=\"woj\">‘People do not live by bread alone,</span><span class=\"woj\">but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”</span>",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple,",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>and said, “If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say,‘He will order his angels to protect you.And they will hold you up with their handsso you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.’”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Jesus responded, <span class=\"woj\">“The Scriptures also say, ‘You must not test the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God.’”</span>",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“I will give it all to you,” he said, “if you will kneel down and worship me.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“Get out of here, Satan,”</span> Jesus told him. <span class=\"woj\">“For the Scriptures say,</span><span class=\"woj\">‘You must worship the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God</span><span class=\"woj\">and serve only him.’”</span>",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of Jesus.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he left Judea and returned to Galilee.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>He went first to Nazareth, then left there and moved to Capernaum, beside the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>This fulfilled what God said through the prophet Isaiah:",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“In the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali,beside the sea, beyond the Jordan River,in Galilee where so many Gentiles live,",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>the people who sat in darknesshave seen a great light.And for those who lived in the land where death casts its shadow,a light has shined.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>From then on Jesus began to preach, <span class=\"woj\">“Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.”</span>",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers—Simon, also called Peter, and Andrew—throwing a net into the water, for they fished for a living.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Jesus called out to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!”</span>",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>And they left their nets at once and followed him.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>A little farther up the shore he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father, Zebedee, repairing their nets. And he called them to come, too.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>They immediately followed him, leaving the boat and their father behind.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>News about him spread as far as Syria, and people soon began bringing to him all who were sick. And whatever their sickness or disease, or if they were demon possessed or epileptic or paralyzed—he healed them all.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Large crowds followed him wherever he went—people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, from all over Judea, and from east of the Jordan River."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>One day as he saw the crowds gathering, Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down. His disciples gathered around him,",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him,</span><span class=\"woj\">for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.</span>",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup><span class=\"woj\">God blesses those who mourn,</span><span class=\"woj\">for they will be comforted.</span>",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.</span>",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless.</span>",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“You are the light of the world—like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden.</span>",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup><span class=\"woj\">No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house.</span>",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup><span class=\"woj\">In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.</span>",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“Don’t misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose.</span>",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup><span class=\"woj\">I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not even the smallest detail of God’s law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.</span>",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup><span class=\"woj\">So if you ignore the least commandment and teach others to do the same, you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who obeys God’s laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</span>",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“But I warn you—unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness of the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven!</span>",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“You have heard that our ancestors were told, ‘You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.’</span>",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup><span class=\"woj\">But I say, if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot, you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone, you are in danger of the fires of hell.</span>",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“So if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you,</span>",

			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup><span class=\"woj\">But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span>",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup><span class=\"woj\">So if your eye—even your good eye—causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</span>",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup><span class=\"woj\">And if your hand—even your stronger hand—causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</span>",

			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup><span class=\"woj\">But I say, do not make any vows! Do not say, ‘By heaven!’ because heaven is God’s throne.</span>",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup><span class=\"woj\">And do not say, ‘By the earth!’ because the earth is his footstool. And do not say, ‘By Jerusalem!’ for Jerusalem is the city of the great King.</span>",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Do not even say, ‘By my head!’ for you can’t turn one hair white or black.</span>",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Just say a simple, ‘Yes, I will,’ or ‘No, I won’t.’ Anything beyond this is from the evil one.</span>",

			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed, <span class=\"woj\">“My Father! If this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will be done.”</span>",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn’t keep their eyes open.",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again.",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>Then he came to the disciples and said, <span class=\"woj\">“Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But look—the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span>",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Up, let’s be going. Look, my betrayer is here!”</span>",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>And even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests and elders of the people.",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal: “You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss.”",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>So Judas came straight to Jesus. “Greetings, Rabbi!” he exclaimed and gave him the kiss.",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“My friend, go ahead and do what you have come for.”</span>Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him.",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51 </sup>But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest’s slave, slashing off his ear.",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52 </sup><span class=\"woj\">“Put away your sword,”</span> Jesus told him. <span class=\"woj\">“Those who use the sword will die by the sword.</span>",
			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53 </sup><span class=\"woj\">Don’t you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly?</span>",
			"54": "<sup class=\"versenum\">54 </sup><span class=\"woj\">But if I did, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what must happen now?”</span>",
			"55": "<sup class=\"versenum\">55 </sup>Then Jesus said to the crowd, <span class=\"woj\">“Am I some dangerous revolutionary, that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me? Why didn’t you arrest me in the Temple? I was there teaching every day.</span>",
			"56": "<sup class=\"versenum\">56 </sup><span class=\"woj\">But this is all happening to fulfill the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures.”</span> At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.",
			"57": "<sup class=\"versenum\">57 </sup>Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered.",
			"58": "<sup class=\"versenum\">58 </sup>Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest’s courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end.",
			"59": "<sup class=\"versenum\">59 </sup>Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council were trying to find witnesses who would lie about Jesus, so they could put him to death.",
			"60": "<sup class=\"versenum\">60 </sup>But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness, they could not use anyone’s testimony. Finally, two men came forward",
			"61": "<sup class=\"versenum\">61 </sup>who declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”",
			"62": "<sup class=\"versenum\">62 </sup>Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Well, aren’t you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?”",
			"63": "<sup class=\"versenum\">63 </sup>But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I demand in the name of the living God—tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”",
			"64": "<sup class=\"versenum\">64 </sup>Jesus replied, <span class=\"woj\">“You have said it. And in the future you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God’s right hand and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span>",
			"65": "<sup class=\"versenum\">65 </sup>Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, “Blasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy.",
			"66": "<sup class=\"versenum\">66 </sup>What is your verdict?”“Guilty!” they shouted. “He deserves to die!”",
			"67": "<sup class=\"versenum\">67 </sup>Then they began to spit in Jesus’ face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him,",
			"68": "<sup class=\"versenum\">68 </sup>jeering, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?”",
			"69": "<sup class=\"versenum\">69 </sup>Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came over and said to him, “You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean.”",
			"70": "<sup class=\"versenum\">70 </sup>But Peter denied it in front of everyone. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.",
			"71": "<sup class=\"versenum\">71 </sup>Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”",
			"72": "<sup class=\"versenum\">72 </sup>Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. “I don’t even know the man,” he said.",
			"73": "<sup class=\"versenum\">73 </sup>A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said, “You must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent.”",
			"74": "<sup class=\"versenum\">74 </sup>Peter swore, “A curse on me if I’m lying—I don’t know the man!” And immediately the rooster crowed.",
			"75": "<sup class=\"versenum\">75 </sup>Suddenly, Jesus’ words flashed through Peter’s mind: <span class=\"woj\">“Before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me.”</span> And he went away, weeping bitterly."

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">27 </span>Very early in the morning the leading priests and the elders of the people met again to lay plans for putting Jesus to death.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Then they bound him, led him away, and took him to Pilate, the Roman governor.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>When Judas, who had betrayed him, realized that Jesus had been condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“I have sinned,” he declared, “for I have betrayed an innocent man.”“What do we care?” they retorted. “That’s your problem.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>The leading priests picked up the coins. “It wouldn’t be right to put this money in the Temple treasury,” they said, “since it was payment for murder.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>After some discussion they finally decided to buy the potter’s field, and they made it into a cemetery for foreigners.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>That is why the field is still called the Field of Blood.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>This fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah that says,“They took the thirty pieces of silver—the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel,",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>and purchased the potter’s field,as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> directed.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Now Jesus was standing before Pilate, the Roman governor. “Are you the king of the Jews?” the governor asked him.Jesus replied, <span class=\"woj\">“You have said it.”</span> ",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>But when the leading priests and the elders made their accusations against him, Jesus remained silent.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>“Don’t you hear all these charges they are bringing against you?” Pilate demanded.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But Jesus made no response to any of the charges, much to the governor’s surprise.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Now it was the governor’s custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner to the crowd—anyone they wanted.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>This year there was a notorious prisoner, a man named Barabbas.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>As the crowds gathered before Pilate’s house that morning, he asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you—Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>(He knew very well that the religious leaders had arrested Jesus out of envy.)",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Just then, as Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Leave that innocent man alone. I suffered through a terrible nightmare about him last night.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Meanwhile, the leading priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be put to death.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>So the governor asked again, “Which of these two do you want me to release to you?”The crowd shouted back, “Barabbas!”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Pilate responded, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?”They shouted back, “Crucify him!”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>“Why?” Pilate demanded. “What crime has he committed?”But the mob roared even louder, “Crucify him!”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Pilate saw that he wasn’t getting anywhere and that a riot was developing. So he sent for a bowl of water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. The responsibility is yours!”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>And all the people yelled back, “We will take responsibility for his death—we and our children!”",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>So Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Some of the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into their headquarters and called out the entire regiment.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>They wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head, and they placed a reed stick in his right hand as a scepter. Then they knelt before him in mockery and taunted, “Hail! King of the Jews!”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>And they spit on him and grabbed the stick and struck him on the head with it.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>Along the way, they came across a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene, and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>And they went out to a place called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”).",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with bitter gall, but when he had tasted it, he refused to drink it.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>After they had nailed him to the cross, the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Then they sat around and kept guard as he hung there.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>A sign was fastened above Jesus’ head, announcing the charge against him. It read: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Two revolutionaries were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>“Look at you now!” they yelled at him. “You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. Well then, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!”",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>The leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders also mocked Jesus.",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>“He saved others,” they scoffed, “but he can’t save himself! So he is the King of Israel, is he? Let him come down from the cross right now, and we will believe in him!",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>He trusted God, so let God rescue him now if he wants him! For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>Even the revolutionaries who were crucified with him ridiculed him in the same way.",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o’clock.",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>At about three o’clock, Jesus called out with a loud voice, <span class=\"woj\"><i>“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”</i></span> which means <span class=\"woj\">“My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”</span>",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah.",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink.",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>But the rest said, “Wait! Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>Then Jesus shouted out again, and he released his spirit.",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51 </sup>At that moment the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split apart,",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52 </sup>and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead.",
			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53 </sup>They left the cemetery after Jesus’ resurrection, went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.",
			"54": "<sup class=\"versenum\">54 </sup>The Roman officer and the other soldiers at the crucifixion were terrified by the earthquake and all that had happened. They said, “This man truly was the Son of God!”",
			"55": "<sup class=\"versenum\">55 </sup>And many women who had come from Galilee with Jesus to care for him were watching from a distance.",
			"56": "<sup class=\"versenum\">56 </sup>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James and Joseph), and the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee.",
			"57": "<sup class=\"versenum\">57 </sup>As evening approached, Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea who had become a follower of Jesus,",
			"58": "<sup class=\"versenum\">58 </sup>went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. And Pilate issued an order to release it to him.",
			"59": "<sup class=\"versenum\">59 </sup>Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a long sheet of clean linen cloth.",
			"60": "<sup class=\"versenum\">60 </sup>He placed it in his own new tomb, which had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance and left.",
			"61": "<sup class=\"versenum\">61 </sup>Both Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb and watching.",
			"62": "<sup class=\"versenum\">62 </sup>The next day, on the Sabbath, the leading priests and Pharisees went to see Pilate.",
			"63": "<sup class=\"versenum\">63 </sup>They told him, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver once said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise from the dead.’",
			"64": "<sup class=\"versenum\">64 </sup>So we request that you seal the tomb until the third day. This will prevent his disciples from coming and stealing his body and then telling everyone he was raised from the dead! If that happens, we’ll be worse off than we were at first.”",
			"65": "<sup class=\"versenum\">65 </sup>Pilate replied, “Take guards and secure it the best you can.”",
			"66": "<sup class=\"versenum\">66 </sup>So they sealed the tomb and posted guards to protect it."

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>The women ran quickly from the tomb. They were very frightened but also filled with great joy, and they rushed to give the disciples the angel’s message.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>And as they went, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they ran to him, grasped his feet, and worshiped him.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Don’t be afraid! Go tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and they will see me there.”</span>",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the leading priests what had happened.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>A meeting with the elders was called, and they decided to give the soldiers a large bribe.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>They told the soldiers, “You must say, ‘Jesus’ disciples came during the night while we were sleeping, and they stole his body.’",
