			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>What do people get for all their hard work under the sun?",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Sometimes people say, “Here is something new!” But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>We don’t remember what happened in the past, and in future generations, no one will remember what we are doing now.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>I, the Teacher, was king of Israel, and I lived in Jerusalem.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>I devoted myself to search for understanding and to explore by wisdom everything being done under heaven. I soon discovered that God has dealt a tragic existence to the human race.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>What is wrong cannot be made right.What is missing cannot be recovered.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>I said to myself, “Look, I am wiser than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have greater wisdom and knowledge than any of them.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>So I set out to learn everything from wisdom to madness and folly. But I learned firsthand that pursuing all this is like chasing the wind.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief.To increase knowledge only increases sorrow."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>I said to myself, “Come on, let’s try pleasure. Let’s look for the ‘good things’ in life.” But I found that this, too, was meaningless.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>So I said, “Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and my wisdom never failed me.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Anything I wanted, I would take. I denied myself no pleasure. I even found great pleasure in hard work, a reward for all my labors.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless—like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness (for who can do this better than I, the king?).",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>I thought, “Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.” Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Both will die. So I said to myself, “Since I will end up the same as the fool, what’s the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>For the wise and the foolish both die. The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool. In the days to come, both will be forgotten.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling. Everything is meaningless—like chasing the wind.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>I came to hate all my hard work here on earth, for I must leave to others everything I have earned.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>And who can tell whether my successors will be wise or foolish? Yet they will control everything I have gained by my skill and hard work under the sun. How meaningless!",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>So I gave up in despair, questioning the value of all my hard work in this world.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Some people work wisely with knowledge and skill, then must leave the fruit of their efforts to someone who hasn’t worked for it. This, too, is meaningless, a great tragedy.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety?",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief; even at night their minds cannot rest. It is all meaningless.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him?",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. This, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>For everything there is a season,a time for every activity under heaven.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>A time to be born and a time to die.A time to plant and a time to harvest.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>A time to kill and a time to heal.A time to tear down and a time to build up.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>A time to cry and a time to laugh.A time to grieve and a time to dance.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones.A time to embrace and a time to turn away.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>A time to search and a time to quit searching.A time to keep and a time to throw away.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>A time to tear and a time to mend.A time to be quiet and a time to speak.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>A time to love and a time to hate.A time for war and a time for peace.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>What do people really get for all their hard work?",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>I have seen the burden God has placed on us all.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Yet God has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart, but even so, people cannot see the whole scope of God’s work from beginning to end.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>So I concluded there is nothing better than to be happy and enjoy ourselves as long as we can.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>And people should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of their labor, for these are gifts from God.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And I know that whatever God does is final. Nothing can be added to it or taken from it. God’s purpose is that people should fear him.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>What is happening now has happened before, and what will happen in the future has happened before, because God makes the same things happen over and over again.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>I also noticed that under the sun there is evil in the courtroom. Yes, even the courts of law are corrupt!",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>I said to myself, “In due season God will judge everyone, both good and bad, for all their deeds.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>I also thought about the human condition—how God proves to people that they are like animals.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>For people and animals share the same fate—both breathe and both must die. So people have no real advantage over the animals. How meaningless!",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Both go to the same place—they came from dust and they return to dust.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>For who can prove that the human spirit goes up and the spirit of animals goes down into the earth?",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>So I saw that there is nothing better for people than to be happy in their work. That is our lot in life. And no one can bring us back to see what happens after we die."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>Again, I observed all the oppression that takes place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, with no one to comfort them. The oppressors have great power, and their victims are helpless.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>So I concluded that the dead are better off than the living.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>But most fortunate of all are those who are not yet born. For they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then I observed that most people are motivated to success because they envy their neighbors. But this, too, is meaningless—like chasing the wind.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“Fools fold their idle hands,leading them to ruin.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And yet,“Better to have one handful with quietnessthan two handfuls with hard workand chasing the wind.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>I observed yet another example of something meaningless under the sun.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>This is the case of a man who is all alone, without a child or a brother, yet who works hard to gain as much wealth as he can. But then he asks himself, “Who am I working for? Why am I giving up so much pleasure now?” It is all so meaningless and depressing.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Likewise, two people lying close together can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone?",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>It is better to be a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who refuses all advice.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Such a youth could rise from poverty and succeed. He might even become king, though he has been in prison.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>But then everyone rushes to the side of yet another youth who replaces him.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Endless crowds stand around him, but then another generation grows up and rejects him, too. So it is all meaningless—like chasing the wind."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>As you enter the house of God, keep your ears open and your mouth shut. It is evil to make mindless offerings to God.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Don’t make rash promises, and don’t be hasty in bringing matters before God. After all, God is in heaven, and you are here on earth. So let your words be few.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Too much activity gives you restless dreams; too many words make you a fool.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>When you make a promise to God, don’t delay in following through, for God takes no pleasure in fools. Keep all the promises you make to him.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>It is better to say nothing than to make a promise and not keep it.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Don’t let your mouth make you sin. And don’t defend yourself by telling the Temple messenger that the promise you made was a mistake. That would make God angry, and he might wipe out everything you have achieved.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Talk is cheap, like daydreams and other useless activities. Fear God instead.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Don’t be surprised if you see a poor person being oppressed by the powerful and if justice is being miscarried throughout the land. For every official is under orders from higher up, and matters of justice get lost in red tape and bureaucracy.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Even the king milks the land for his own profit!",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Those who love money will never have enough. How meaningless to think that wealth brings true happiness!",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The more you have, the more people come to help you spend it. So what good is wealth—except perhaps to watch it slip through your fingers!",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>People who work hard sleep well, whether they eat little or much. But the rich seldom get a good night’s sleep.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>There is another serious problem I have seen under the sun. Hoarding riches harms the saver.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Money is put into risky investments that turn sour, and everything is lost. In the end, there is nothing left to pass on to one’s children.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>We all come to the end of our lives as naked and empty-handed as on the day we were born. We can’t take our riches with us.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And this, too, is a very serious problem. People leave this world no better off than when they came. All their hard work is for nothing—like working for the wind.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Throughout their lives, they live under a cloud—frustrated, discouraged, and angry.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Even so, I have noticed one thing, at least, that is good. It is good for people to eat, drink, and enjoy their work under the sun during the short life God has given them, and to accept their lot in life.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>And it is a good thing to receive wealth from God and the good health to enjoy it. To enjoy your work and accept your lot in life—this is indeed a gift from God.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>God keeps such people so busy enjoying life that they take no time to brood over the past."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>There is another serious tragedy I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily on humanity.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>God gives some people great wealth and honor and everything they could ever want, but then he doesn’t give them the chance to enjoy these things. They die, and someone else, even a stranger, ends up enjoying their wealth! This is meaningless—a sickening tragedy.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>A man might have a hundred children and live to be very old. But if he finds no satisfaction in life and doesn’t even get a decent burial, it would have been better for him to be born dead.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>His birth would have been meaningless, and he would have ended in darkness. He wouldn’t even have had a name,",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>and he would never have seen the sun or known of its existence. Yet he would have had more peace than in growing up to be an unhappy man.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>He might live a thousand years twice over but still not find contentment. And since he must die like everyone else—well, what’s the use?",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>So are wise people really better off than fools? Do poor people gain anything by being wise and knowing how to act in front of others?",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Enjoy what you have rather than desiring what you don’t have. Just dreaming about nice things is meaningless—like chasing the wind.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Everything has already been decided. It was known long ago what each person would be. So there’s no use arguing with God about your destiny.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The more words you speak, the less they mean. So what good are they?",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>In the few days of our meaningless lives, who knows how our days can best be spent? Our lives are like a shadow. Who can tell what will happen on this earth after we are gone?"
		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7 </span>A good reputation is more valuable than costly perfume.And the day you die is better than the day you are born.",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Sorrow is better than laughter,for sadness has a refining influence on us.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>A wise person thinks a lot about death,while a fool thinks only about having a good time.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Better to be criticized by a wise personthan to be praised by a fool.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>A fool’s laughter is quickly gone,like thorns crackling in a fire.This also is meaningless.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Extortion turns wise people into fools,and bribes corrupt the heart.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Finishing is better than starting.Patience is better than pride.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Control your temper,for anger labels you a fool.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Don’t long for “the good old days.”This is not wise.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Wisdom is even better when you have money.Both are a benefit as you go through life.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Wisdom and money can get you almost anything,but only wisdom can save your life.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Accept the way God does things,for who can straighten what he has made crooked?",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Enjoy prosperity while you can,but when hard times strike, realize that both come from God.Remember that nothing is certain in this life.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>I have seen everything in this meaningless life, including the death of good young people and the long life of wicked people.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So don’t be too good or too wise! Why destroy yourself?",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>On the other hand, don’t be too wicked either. Don’t be a fool! Why die before your time?",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Pay attention to these instructions, for anyone who fears God will avoid both extremes.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>One wise person is stronger than ten leading citizens of a town!",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Not a single person on earth is always good and never sins.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Don’t eavesdrop on others—you may hear your servant curse you.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>For you know how often you yourself have cursed others.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>I have always tried my best to let wisdom guide my thoughts and actions. I said to myself, “I am determined to be wise.” But it didn’t work.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Wisdom is always distant and difficult to find.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>I searched everywhere, determined to find wisdom and to understand the reason for things. I was determined to prove to myself that wickedness is stupid and that foolishness is madness.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>I discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death. Her passion is a snare, and her soft hands are chains. Those who are pleasing to God will escape her, but sinners will be caught in her snare.",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Don’t try to avoid doing your duty, and don’t stand with those who plot evil, for the king can do whatever he wants.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>His command is backed by great power. No one can resist or question it.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Those who obey him will not be punished. Those who are wise will find a time and a way to do what is right,",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>I have seen wicked people buried with honor. Yet they were the very ones who frequented the Temple and are now praised in the same city where they committed their crimes! This, too, is meaningless.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>When a crime is not punished quickly, people feel it is safe to do wrong.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>But even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time, I know that those who fear God will be better off.",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And this is not all that is meaningless in our world. In this life, good people are often treated as though they were wicked, and wicked people are often treated as though they were good. This is so meaningless!",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>So I recommend having fun, because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat, drink, and enjoy life. That way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work God gives them under the sun.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>In my search for wisdom and in my observation of people’s burdens here on earth, I discovered that there is ceaseless activity, day and night.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>I realized that no one can discover everything God is doing under the sun. Not even the wisest people discover everything, no matter what they claim."
		},
		"9": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">9 </span>This, too, I carefully explored: Even though the actions of godly and wise people are in God’s hands, no one knows whether God will show them favor.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The same destiny ultimately awaits everyone, whether righteous or wicked, good or bad, ceremonially clean or unclean, religious or irreligious. Good people receive the same treatment as sinners, and people who make promises to God are treated like people who don’t.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>It seems so wrong that everyone under the sun suffers the same fate. Already twisted by evil, people choose their own mad course, for they have no hope. There is nothing ahead but death anyway.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>There is hope only for the living. As they say, “It’s better to be a live dog than a dead lion!”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The living at least know they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, nor are they remembered.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Whatever they did in their lifetime—loving, hating, envying—is all long gone. They no longer play a part in anything here on earth.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>So go ahead. Eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God approves of this!",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Wear fine clothes, with a splash of cologne!",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Whatever you do, do well. For when you go to the grave, there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn’t always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don’t always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>People can never predict when hard times might come. Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy.",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>There was a small town with only a few people, and a great king came with his army and besieged it.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>A poor, wise man knew how to save the town, and so it was rescued. But afterward no one thought to thank him.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So even though wisdom is better than strength, those who are wise will be despised if they are poor. What they say will not be appreciated for long.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Better to hear the quiet words of a wise personthan the shouts of a foolish king.",

		"10": {

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>If your boss is angry at you, don’t quit!A quiet spirit can overcome even great mistakes.",
