			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, “Which tribe should go first to attack the Canaanites?”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> answered, “Judah, for I have given them victory over the land.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The men of Judah said to their relatives from the tribe of Simeon, “Join with us to fight against the Canaanites living in the territory allotted to us. Then we will help you conquer your territory.” So the men of Simeon went with Judah.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>When the men of Judah attacked, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave them victory over the Canaanites and Perizzites, and they killed 10,000 enemy warriors at the town of Bezek.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>While at Bezek they encountered King Adoni-bezek and fought against him, and the Canaanites and Perizzites were defeated.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Adoni-bezek escaped, but the Israelites soon captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Adoni-bezek said, “I once had seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off, eating scraps from under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” They took him to Jerusalem, and he died there.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it, killing all its people and setting the city on fire.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then they went down to fight the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Judah marched against the Canaanites in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath-arba), defeating the forces of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>From there they went to fight against the people living in the town of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher).",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother, Kenaz, was the one who conquered it, so Acsah became Othniel’s wife.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>When Acsah married Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she got down off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What’s the matter?”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>She said, “Let me have another gift. You have already given me land in the Negev; now please give me springs of water, too.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>When the tribe of Judah left Jericho—the city of palms—the Kenites, who were descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, traveled with them into the wilderness of Judah. They settled among the people there, near the town of Arad in the Negev.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Then Judah joined with Simeon to fight against the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they completely destroyed the town. So the town was named Hormah.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>In addition, Judah captured the towns of Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, along with their surrounding territories.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was with the people of Judah, and they took possession of the hill country. But they failed to drive out the people living in the plains, who had iron chariots.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The town of Hebron was given to Caleb as Moses had promised. And Caleb drove out the people living there, who were descendants of the three sons of Anak.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>The tribe of Benjamin, however, failed to drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live in Jerusalem among the people of Benjamin.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>The descendants of Joseph attacked the town of Bethel, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was with them.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>They sent men to scout out Bethel (formerly known as Luz).",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>They confronted a man coming out of the town and said to him, “Show us a way into the town, and we will have mercy on you.”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>So he showed them a way in, and they killed everyone in the town except that man and his family.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Later the man moved to the land of the Hittites, where he built a town. He named it Luz, which is its name to this day.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>The tribe of Manasseh failed to drive out the people living in Beth-shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and all their surrounding settlements, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in that region.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>When the Israelites grew stronger, they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves, but they never did drive them completely out of the land.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>The tribe of Ephraim failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so the Canaanites continued to live there among them.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>The tribe of Zebulun failed to drive out the residents of Kitron and Nahalol, so the Canaanites continued to live among them. But the Canaanites were forced to work as slaves for the people of Zebulun.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>The tribe of Asher failed to drive out the residents of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>Instead, the people of Asher moved in among the Canaanites, who controlled the land, for they failed to drive them out.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Likewise, the tribe of Naphtali failed to drive out the residents of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath. Instead, they moved in among the Canaanites, who controlled the land. Nevertheless, the people of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were forced to work as slaves for the people of Naphtali.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>As for the tribe of Dan, the Amorites forced them back into the hill country and would not let them come down into the plains.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>The Amorites were determined to stay in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but when the descendants of Joseph became stronger, they forced the Amorites to work as slaves.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>The boundary of the Amorites ran from Scorpion Pass to Sela and continued upward from there."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>The angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said to the Israelites, “I brought you out of Egypt into this land that I swore to give your ancestors, and I said I would never break my covenant with you.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>For your part, you were not to make any covenants with the people living in this land; instead, you were to destroy their altars. But you disobeyed my command. Why did you do this?",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>So now I declare that I will no longer drive out the people living in your land. They will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a constant temptation to you.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>When the angel of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> finished speaking to all the Israelites, the people wept loudly.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>So they called the place Bokim (which means “weeping”), and they offered sacrifices there to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>After Joshua sent the people away, each of the tribes left to take possession of the land allotted to them.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>And the Israelites served the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> throughout the lifetime of Joshua and the leaders who outlived him—those who had seen all the great things the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had done for Israel.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, died at the age of 110.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>They buried him in the land he had been allocated, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>After that generation died, another generation grew up who did not acknowledge the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> or remember the mighty things he had done for Israel.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The Israelites did evil in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s sight and served the images of Baal.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>They abandoned the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They went after other gods, worshiping the gods of the people around them. And they angered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>They abandoned the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> to serve Baal and the images of Ashtoreth.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>This made the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> burn with anger against Israel, so he handed them over to raiders who stole their possessions. He turned them over to their enemies all around, and they were no longer able to resist them.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Every time Israel went out to battle, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> fought against them, causing them to be defeated, just as he had warned. And the people were in great distress.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> raised up judges to rescue the Israelites from their attackers.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Yet Israel did not listen to the judges but prostituted themselves by worshiping other gods. How quickly they turned away from the path of their ancestors, who had walked in obedience to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s commands.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Whenever the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> raised up a judge over Israel, he was with that judge and rescued the people from their enemies throughout the judge’s lifetime. For the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> took pity on his people, who were burdened by oppression and suffering.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>But when the judge died, the people returned to their corrupt ways, behaving worse than those who had lived before them. They went after other gods, serving and worshiping them. And they refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> burned with anger against Israel. He said, “Because these people have violated my covenant, which I made with their ancestors, and have ignored my commands,",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>I will no longer drive out the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>I did this to test Israel—to see whether or not they would follow the ways of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> as their ancestors did.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>That is why the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> left those nations in place. He did not quickly drive them out or allow Joshua to conquer them all."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>These are the nations that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> left in the land to test those Israelites who had not experienced the wars of Canaan.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>He did this to teach warfare to generations of Israelites who had no experience in battle.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>These are the nations: the Philistines (those living under the five Philistine rulers), all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>These people were left to test the Israelites—to see whether they would obey the commands the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had given to their ancestors through Moses.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>and they intermarried with them. Israelite sons married their daughters, and Israelite daughters were given in marriage to their sons. And the Israelites served their gods.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The Israelites did evil in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s sight. They forgot about the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> their God, and they served the images of Baal and the Asherah poles.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> burned with anger against Israel, and he turned them over to King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim. And the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>But when the people of Israel cried out to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> for help, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> raised up a rescuer to save them. His name was Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother, Kenaz.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The Spirit of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> came upon him, and he became Israel’s judge. He went to war against King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave Othniel victory over him.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So there was peace in the land for forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Once again the Israelites did evil in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s sight, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave King Eglon of Moab control over Israel because of their evil.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Eglon enlisted the Ammonites and Amalekites as allies, and then he went out and defeated Israel, taking possession of Jericho, the city of palms.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And the Israelites served Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>But when the people of Israel cried out to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> for help, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> again raised up a rescuer to save them. His name was Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed man of the tribe of Benjamin. The Israelites sent Ehud to deliver their tribute money to King Eglon of Moab.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So Ehud made a double-edged dagger that was about a foot long, and he strapped it to his right thigh, keeping it hidden under his clothing.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>He brought the tribute money to Eglon, who was very fat.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>After delivering the payment, Ehud started home with those who had helped carry the tribute.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>But when Ehud reached the stone idols near Gilgal, he turned back. He came to Eglon and said, “I have a secret message for you.”So the king commanded his servants, “Be quiet!” and he sent them all out of the room.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Ehud walked over to Eglon, who was sitting alone in a cool upstairs room. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you!” As King Eglon rose from his seat,",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled out the dagger strapped to his right thigh, and plunged it into the king’s belly.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>The dagger went so deep that the handle disappeared beneath the king’s fat. So Ehud did not pull out the dagger, and the king’s bowels emptied.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Then Ehud closed and locked the doors of the room and escaped down the latrine.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>After Ehud was gone, the king’s servants returned and found the doors to the upstairs room locked. They thought he might be using the latrine in the room,",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>so they waited. But when the king didn’t come out after a long delay, they became concerned and got a key. And when they opened the doors, they found their master dead on the floor.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>While the servants were waiting, Ehud escaped, passing the stone idols on his way to Seirah.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>When he arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, Ehud sounded a call to arms. Then he led a band of Israelites down from the hills.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>“Follow me,” he said, “for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has given you victory over Moab your enemy.” So they followed him. And the Israelites took control of the shallow crossings of the Jordan River across from Moab, preventing anyone from crossing.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>They attacked the Moabites and killed about 10,000 of their strongest and most able-bodied warriors. Not one of them escaped.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>So Moab was conquered by Israel that day, and there was peace in the land for eighty years.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath rescued Israel. He once killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>After Ehud’s death, the Israelites again did evil in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s sight.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> turned them over to King Jabin of Hazor, a Canaanite king. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-haggoyim.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Sisera, who had 900 iron chariots, ruthlessly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. Then the people of Israel cried out to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> for help.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet who was judging Israel at that time.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>She would sit under the Palm of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites would go to her for judgment.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam, who lived in Kedesh in the land of Naphtali. She said to him, “This is what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, commands you: Call out 10,000 warriors from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun at Mount Tabor.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>And I will call out Sisera, commander of Jabin’s army, along with his chariots and warriors, to the Kishon River. There I will give you victory over him.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Barak told her, “I will go, but only if you go with me.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“Very well,” she replied, “I will go with you. But you will receive no honor in this venture, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s victory over Sisera will be at the hands of a woman.” So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>At Kedesh, Barak called together the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, and 10,000 warriors went up with him. Deborah also went with him.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Now Heber the Kenite, a descendant of Moses’ brother-in-law Hobab, had moved away from the other members of his tribe and pitched his tent by the oak of Zaanannim near Kedesh.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>he called for all 900 of his iron chariots and all of his warriors, and they marched from Harosheth-haggoyim to the Kishon River.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then Deborah said to Barak, “Get ready! This is the day the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will give you victory over Sisera, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is marching ahead of you.” So Barak led his 10,000 warriors down the slopes of Mount Tabor into battle.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>When Barak attacked, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> threw Sisera and all his chariots and warriors into a panic. Sisera leaped down from his chariot and escaped on foot.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Then Barak chased the chariots and the enemy army all the way to Harosheth-haggoyim, killing all of Sisera’s warriors. Not a single one was left alive.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Meanwhile, Sisera ran to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because Heber’s family was on friendly terms with King Jabin of Hazor.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come into my tent, sir. Come in. Don’t be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>“Please give me some water,” he said. “I’m thirsty.” So she gave him some milk from a leather bag and covered him again.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>“Stand at the door of the tent,” he told her. “If anybody comes and asks you if there is anyone here, say no.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>But when Sisera fell asleep from exhaustion, Jael quietly crept up to him with a hammer and tent peg in her hand. Then she drove the tent peg through his temple and into the ground, and so he died.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>When Barak came looking for Sisera, Jael went out to meet him. She said, “Come, and I will show you the man you are looking for.” So he followed her into the tent and found Sisera lying there dead, with the tent peg through his temple.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>So on that day Israel saw God defeat Jabin, the Canaanite king.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>And from that time on Israel became stronger and stronger against King Jabin until they finally destroyed him."

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Afterward Delilah said to him, “You’ve been making fun of me and telling me lies! Now please tell me how you can be tied up securely.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Samson replied, “If I were tied up with brand-new ropes that had never been used, I would become as weak as anyone else.”",

			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>She tormented him with her nagging day after day until he was sick to death of it.",

			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Delilah realized he had finally told her the truth, so she sent for the Philistine rulers. “Come back one more time,” she said, “for he has finally told me his secret.” So the Philistine rulers returned with the money in their hands.",

			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>So I cut her body into twelve pieces and sent the pieces throughout the territory assigned to Israel, for these men have committed a terrible and shameful crime.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Now then, all of you—the entire community of Israel—must decide here and now what should be done about this!”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>And all the people rose to their feet in unison and declared, “None of us will return home! No, not even one of us!",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Instead, this is what we will do to Gibeah; we will draw lots to decide who will attack it.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>One-tenth of the men from each tribe will be chosen to supply the warriors with food, and the rest of us will take revenge on Gibeah of Benjamin for this shameful thing they have done in Israel.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So all the Israelites were completely united, and they gathered together to attack the town.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The Israelites sent messengers to the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What a terrible thing has been done among you!",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Give up those evil men, those troublemakers from Gibeah, so we can execute them and purge Israel of this evil.”But the people of Benjamin would not listen.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Instead, they came from their towns and gathered at Gibeah to fight the Israelites.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>In all, 26,000 of their warriors armed with swords arrived in Gibeah to join the 700 elite troops who lived there.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Among Benjamin’s elite troops, 700 were left-handed, and each of them could sling a rock and hit a target within a hairsbreadth without missing.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Israel had 400,000 experienced soldiers armed with swords, not counting Benjamin’s warriors.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Before the battle the Israelites went to Bethel and asked God, “Which tribe should go first to attack the people of Benjamin?”The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> answered, “Judah is to go first.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>So the Israelites left early the next morning and camped near Gibeah.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Then they advanced toward Gibeah to attack the men of Benjamin.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>But Benjamin’s warriors, who were defending the town, came out and killed 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But the Israelites encouraged each other and took their positions again at the same place they had fought the previous day.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>For they had gone up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> until evening. They had asked the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, “Should we fight against our relatives from Benjamin again?”And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had said, “Go out and fight against them.”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>So the next day they went out again to fight against the men of Benjamin,",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>but the men of Benjamin killed another 18,000 Israelites, all of whom were experienced with the sword.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Then all the Israelites went up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and fasted until evening. They also brought burnt offerings and peace offerings to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>The Israelites went up seeking direction from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. (In those days the Ark of the Covenant of God was in Bethel,",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>and Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron was the priest.) The Israelites asked the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, “Should we fight against our relatives from Benjamin again, or should we stop?”The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said, “Go! Tomorrow I will hand them over to you.”",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>So the Israelites set an ambush all around Gibeah.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>They went out on the third day and took their positions at the same place as before.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>When the men of Benjamin came out to attack, they were drawn away from the town. And as they had done before, they began to kill the Israelites. About thirty Israelites died in the open fields and along the roads, one leading to Bethel and the other leading back to Gibeah.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>Then the warriors of Benjamin shouted, “We’re defeating them as we did before!” But the Israelites had planned in advance to run away so that the men of Benjamin would chase them along the roads and be drawn away from the town.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>When the main group of Israelite warriors reached Baal-tamar, they turned and took up their positions. Meanwhile, the Israelites hiding in ambush to the west of Gibeah jumped up to fight.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>There were 10,000 elite Israelite troops who advanced against Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that Benjamin didn’t realize the impending disaster.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>So the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> helped Israel defeat Benjamin, and that day the Israelites killed 25,100 of Benjamin’s warriors, all of whom were experienced swordsmen.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Then the men of Benjamin saw that they were beaten.The Israelites had retreated from Benjamin’s warriors in order to give those hiding in ambush more room to maneuver against Gibeah.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>Then those who were hiding rushed in from all sides and killed everyone in the town.",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>They had arranged to send up a large cloud of smoke from the town as a signal.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>When the Israelites saw the smoke, they turned and attacked Benjamin’s warriors.By that time Benjamin’s warriors had killed about thirty Israelites, and they shouted, “We’re defeating them as we did in the first battle!”",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>But when the warriors of Benjamin looked behind them and saw the smoke rising into the sky from every part of the town,",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>the men of Israel turned and attacked. At this point the men of Benjamin became terrified, because they realized disaster was close at hand.",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>So they turned around and fled before the Israelites toward the wilderness. But they couldn’t escape the battle, and the people who came out of the nearby towns were also killed.",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>The Israelites surrounded the men of Benjamin and chased them relentlessly, finally overtaking them east of Gibeah.",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>That day 18,000 of Benjamin’s strongest warriors died in battle.",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>The survivors fled into the wilderness toward the rock of Rimmon, but Israel killed 5,000 of them along the road. They continued the chase until they had killed another 2,000 near Gidom.",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>So that day the tribe of Benjamin lost 25,000 strong warriors armed with swords,",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>leaving only 600 men who escaped to the rock of Rimmon, where they lived for four months.",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>And the Israelites returned and slaughtered every living thing in all the towns—the people, the livestock, and everything they found. They also burned down all the towns they came to."

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">21 </span>The Israelites had vowed at Mizpah, “We will never give our daughters in marriage to a man from the tribe of Benjamin.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Now the people went to Bethel and sat in the presence of God until evening, weeping loudly and bitterly.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>“O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, God of Israel,” they cried out, “why has this happened in Israel? Now one of our tribes is missing from Israel!”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Early the next morning the people built an altar and presented their burnt offerings and peace offerings on it.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then they said, “Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we held our assembly in the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>?” At that time they had taken a solemn oath in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s presence, vowing that anyone who refused to come would be put to death.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>The Israelites felt sorry for their brother Benjamin and said, “Today one of the tribes of Israel has been cut off.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>How can we find wives for the few who remain, since we have sworn by the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> not to give them our daughters in marriage?”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>So they asked, “Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we assembled in the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>?” And they discovered that no one from Jabesh-gilead had attended the assembly.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>For after they counted all the people, no one from Jabesh-gilead was present.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So the assembly sent 12,000 of their best warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>“This is what you are to do,” they said. “Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found 400 young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the remaining people of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the 400 women of Jabesh-gilead who had been spared were given to them as wives. But there were not enough women for all of them.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had made this gap among the tribes of Israel.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So the elders of the assembly asked, “How can we find wives for the few who remain, since the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead?",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel is not wiped out.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God’s curse.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Then they thought of the annual festival of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> held in Shiloh, south of Lebonah and north of Bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, “Go and hide in the vineyards.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>When you see the young women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to the land of Benjamin to be your wife!",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, ‘Please be sympathetic. Let them have your daughters, for we didn’t find wives for all of them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not actually give your daughters to them in marriage.’”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>So the men of Benjamin did as they were told. Each man caught one of the women as she danced in the celebration and carried her off to be his wife. They returned to their own land, and they rebuilt their towns and lived in them.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Then the people of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.",
