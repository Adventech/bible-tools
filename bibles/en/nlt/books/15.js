The logs were brought down from the Lebanon mountains and floated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to Joppa, for King Cyrus had given permission for this.",

The work force was made up of everyone who had returned from exile, including Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his fellow priests, and all the Levites. The Levites who were twenty years old or older were put in charge of rebuilding the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s Temple.",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>With praise and thanks, they sang this song to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>:“He is so good!His faithful love for Israel endures forever!”Then all the people gave a great shout, praising the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> because the foundation of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s Temple had been laid.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>But many of the older priests, Levites, and other leaders who had seen the first Temple wept aloud when they saw the new Temple’s foundation. The others, however, were shouting for joy.",

We alone will build the Temple for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, just as King Cyrus of Persia commanded us.”",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>They also sent greetings from the rest of the people whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal had deported and relocated in Samaria and throughout the neighboring lands of the province west of the Euphrates River.",

			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>We suggest that a search be made in your ancestors’ records, where you will discover what a rebellious city this has been in the past. In fact, it was destroyed because of its long and troublesome history of revolt against the kings and countries who controlled it.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>We declare to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, the province west of the Euphrates River will be lost to you.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Then King Artaxerxes sent this reply:“To Rehum the governor, Shimshai the court secretary, and their colleagues living in Samaria and throughout the province west of the Euphrates River. Greetings.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>“The letter you sent has been translated and read to me.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>I ordered a search of the records and have found that Jerusalem has indeed been a hotbed of insurrection against many kings. In fact, rebellion and revolt are normal there!",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Powerful kings have ruled over Jerusalem and the entire province west of the Euphrates River, receiving tribute, customs, and tolls.",

			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Be diligent, and don’t neglect this matter, for we must not permit the situation to harm the king’s interests.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>When this letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai, and their colleagues, they hurried to Jerusalem. Then, with a show of strength, they forced the Jews to stop building.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>So the work on the Temple of God in Jerusalem had stopped, and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>At that time the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem. They prophesied in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“We asked the leaders, ‘Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure?’",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>And we demanded their names so that we could tell you who the leaders were.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>“This was their answer: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the Temple that was built here many years ago by a great king of Israel.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he abandoned them to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who destroyed this Temple and exiled the people to Babylonia.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>However, King Cyrus of Babylon, during the first year of his reign, issued a decree that the Temple of God should be rebuilt.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>King Cyrus returned the gold and silver cups that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple of God in Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of Babylon. These cups were taken from that temple and presented to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom King Cyrus appointed as governor of Judah.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The king instructed him to return the cups to their place in Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple of God there on its original site.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem. The people have been working on it ever since, though it is not yet completed.’",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“Therefore, if it pleases the king, we request that a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to discover whether King Cyrus ever issued a decree to rebuild God’s Temple in Jerusalem. And then let the king send us his decision in this matter.”"
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>So King Darius issued orders that a search be made in the Babylonian archives, which were stored in the treasury.",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>“In the first year of King Cyrus’s reign, a decree was sent out concerning the Temple of God at Jerusalem.“Let the Temple be rebuilt on the site where Jews used to offer their sacrifices, using the original foundations. Its height will be ninety feet, and its width will be ninety feet.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Every three layers of specially prepared stones will be topped by a layer of timber. All expenses will be paid by the royal treasury.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Furthermore, the gold and silver cups, which were taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar from the Temple of God in Jerusalem, must be returned to Jerusalem and put back where they belong. Let them be taken back to the Temple of God.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>So King Darius sent this message:“Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River, and Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues and other officials west of the Euphrates River—stay away from there!",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Do not disturb the construction of the Temple of God. Let it be rebuilt on its original site, and do not hinder the governor of Judah and the elders of the Jews in their work.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“Moreover, I hereby decree that you are to help these elders of the Jews as they rebuild this Temple of God. You must pay the full construction costs, without delay, from my taxes collected in the province west of the Euphrates River so that the work will not be interrupted.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“Give the priests in Jerusalem whatever is needed in the way of young bulls, rams, and male lambs for the burnt offerings presented to the God of heaven. And without fail, provide them with as much wheat, salt, wine, and olive oil as they need each day.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then they will be able to offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the welfare of the king and his sons.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>“Those who violate this decree in any way will have a beam pulled from their house. Then they will be lifted up and impaled on it, and their house will be reduced to a pile of rubble.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>May the God who has chosen the city of Jerusalem as the place to honor his name destroy any king or nation that violates this command and destroys this Temple.“I, Darius, have issued this decree. Let it be obeyed with all diligence.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues complied at once with the command of King Darius.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>So the Jewish elders continued their work, and they were greatly encouraged by the preaching of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo. The Temple was finally finished, as had been commanded by the God of Israel and decreed by Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, the kings of Persia.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The Temple was completed on March 12, during the sixth year of King Darius’s reign.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>The Temple of God was then dedicated with great joy by the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the people who had returned from exile.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>During the dedication ceremony for the Temple of God, 100 young bulls, 200 rams, and 400 male lambs were sacrificed. And 12 male goats were presented as a sin offering for the twelve tribes of Israel.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Then the priests and Levites were divided into their various divisions to serve at the Temple of God in Jerusalem, as prescribed in the Book of Moses.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>On April 21 the returned exiles celebrated Passover.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were ceremonially clean. So they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves.",

			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Then they celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. There was great joy throughout the land because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> had caused the king of Assyria to be favorable to them, so that he helped them to rebuild the Temple of God, the God of Israel."

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>From the family of Adonikam, who came later: Eliphelet, Jeuel, Shemaiah, and 60 other men.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>From the family of Bigvai: Uthai, Zaccur, and 70 other men.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>I assembled the exiles at the Ahava Canal, and we camped there for three days while I went over the lists of the people and the priests who had arrived. I found that not one Levite had volunteered to come along.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders of the people. I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of discernment.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>I sent them to Iddo, the leader of the Levites at Casiphia, to ask him and his relatives and the Temple servants to send us ministers for the Temple of God at Jerusalem.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Since the gracious hand of our God was on us, they sent us a man named Sherebiah, along with eighteen of his sons and brothers. He was a very astute man and a descendant of Mahli, who was a descendant of Levi son of Israel.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>They also sent Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and twenty of his sons and brothers,",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>and 220 Temple servants. The Temple servants were assistants to the Levites—a group of Temple workers first instituted by King David and his officials. They were all listed by name.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>And there by the Ahava Canal, I gave orders for all of us to fast and humble ourselves before our God. We prayed that he would give us a safe journey and protect us, our children, and our goods as we traveled.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to accompany us and protect us from enemies along the way. After all, we had told the king, “Our God’s hand of protection is on all who worship him, but his fierce anger rages against those who abandon him.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>So we fasted and earnestly prayed that our God would take care of us, and he heard our prayer.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>I appointed twelve leaders of the priests—Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten other priests—",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>to be in charge of transporting the silver, the gold, the gold bowls, and the other items that the king, his council, his officials, and all the people of Israel had presented for the Temple of God.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>I weighed the treasure as I gave it to them and found the totals to be as follows:24 tons of silver,7,500 pounds of silver articles,7,500 pounds of gold,",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>20 gold bowls, equal in value to 1,000 gold coins,2 fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>And I said to these priests, “You and these treasures have been set apart as holy to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>. This silver and gold is a voluntary offering to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of our ancestors.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Guard these treasures well until you present them to the leading priests, the Levites, and the leaders of Israel, who will weigh them at the storerooms of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s Temple in Jerusalem.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>So the priests and the Levites accepted the task of transporting these treasures of silver and gold to the Temple of our God in Jerusalem.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>We broke camp at the Ahava Canal on April 19 and started off to Jerusalem. And the gracious hand of our God protected us and saved us from enemies and bandits along the way.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>So we arrived safely in Jerusalem, where we rested for three days.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>On the fourth day after our arrival, the silver, gold, and other valuables were weighed at the Temple of our God and entrusted to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest and to Eleazar son of Phinehas, along with Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui—both of whom were Levites.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the total weight was officially recorded.",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>Then the exiles who had come out of captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel. They presented twelve bulls for all the people of Israel, as well as ninety-six rams and seventy-seven male lambs. They also offered twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was given as a burnt offering to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>The king’s decrees were delivered to his highest officers and the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River, who then cooperated by supporting the people and the Temple of God."

		"9": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">9 </span>When these things had been done, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, “Many of the people of Israel, and even some of the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the other peoples living in the land. They have taken up the detestable practices of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>For the men of Israel have married women from these people and have taken them as wives for their sons. So the holy race has become polluted by these mixed marriages. Worse yet, the leaders and officials have led the way in this outrage.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>When I heard this, I tore my cloak and my shirt, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down utterly shocked.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel came and sat with me because of this outrage committed by the returned exiles. And I sat there utterly appalled until the time of the evening sacrifice.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>At the time of the sacrifice, I stood up from where I had sat in mourning with my clothes torn. I fell to my knees and lifted my hands to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> my God.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>I prayed,“O my God, I am utterly ashamed; I blush to lift up my face to you. For our sins are piled higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached to the heavens.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>From the days of our ancestors until now, we have been steeped in sin. That is why we and our kings and our priests have been at the mercy of the pagan kings of the land. We have been killed, captured, robbed, and disgraced, just as we are today.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“But now we have been given a brief moment of grace, for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> our God has allowed a few of us to survive as a remnant. He has given us security in this holy place. Our God has brightened our eyes and granted us some relief from our slavery.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>For we were slaves, but in his unfailing love our God did not abandon us in our slavery. Instead, he caused the kings of Persia to treat us favorably. He revived us so we could rebuild the Temple of our God and repair its ruins. He has given us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“And now, O our God, what can we say after all of this? For once again we have abandoned your commands!",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Your servants the prophets warned us when they said, ‘The land you are entering to possess is totally defiled by the detestable practices of the people living there. From one end to the other, the land is filled with corruption.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Don’t let your daughters marry their sons! Don’t take their daughters as wives for your sons. Don’t ever promote the peace and prosperity of those nations. If you follow these instructions, you will be strong and will enjoy the good things the land produces, and you will leave this prosperity to your children forever.’",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>“Now we are being punished because of our wickedness and our great guilt. But we have actually been punished far less than we deserve, for you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive as a remnant.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But even so, we are again breaking your commands and intermarrying with people who do these detestable things. Won’t your anger be enough to destroy us, so that even this little remnant no longer survives?",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, God of Israel, you are just. We come before you in our guilt as nothing but an escaped remnant, though in such a condition none of us can stand in your presence.”"

		"10": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">10 </span>While Ezra prayed and made this confession, weeping and lying face down on the ground in front of the Temple of God, a very large crowd of people from Israel—men, women, and children—gathered and wept bitterly with him.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, a descendant of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God, for we have married these pagan women of the land. But in spite of this there is hope for Israel.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Let us now make a covenant with our God to divorce our pagan wives and to send them away with their children. We will follow the advice given by you and by the others who respect the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law of God.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Get up, for it is your duty to tell us how to proceed in setting things straight. We are behind you, so be strong and take action.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>So Ezra stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests and the Levites and all the people of Israel swear that they would do as Shecaniah had said. And they all swore a solemn oath.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Then Ezra left the front of the Temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He spent the night there without eating or drinking anything. He was still in mourning because of the unfaithfulness of the returned exiles.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Then a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should come to Jerusalem.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Those who failed to come within three days would, if the leaders and elders so decided, forfeit all their property and be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Within three days, all the people of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. This took place on December 19, and all the people were sitting in the square before the Temple of God. They were trembling both because of the seriousness of the matter and because it was raining.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then Ezra the priest stood and said to them: “You have committed a terrible sin. By marrying pagan women, you have increased Israel’s guilt.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So now confess your sin to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, and do what he demands. Separate yourselves from the people of the land and from these pagan women.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Then the whole assembly raised their voices and answered, “Yes, you are right; we must do as you say!”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then they added, “This isn’t something that can be done in a day or two, for many of us are involved in this extremely sinful affair. And this is the rainy season, so we cannot stay out here much longer.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Let our leaders act on behalf of us all. Let everyone who has a pagan wife come at a scheduled time, accompanied by the leaders and judges of his city, so that the fierce anger of our God concerning this affair may be turned away from us.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this course of action, and they were supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So this was the plan they followed. Ezra selected leaders to represent their families, designating each of the representatives by name. On December 29, the leaders sat down to investigate the matter.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>By March 27, the first day of the new year, they had finished dealing with all the men who had married pagan wives.",
