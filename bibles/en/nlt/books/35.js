			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>This is the message that the prophet Habakkuk received in a vision.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>How long, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, must I call for help?But you do not listen!“Violence is everywhere!” I cry,but you do not come to save.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Must I forever see these evil deeds?Why must I watch all this misery?Wherever I look,I see destruction and violence.I am surrounded by peoplewho love to argue and fight.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>The law has become paralyzed,and there is no justice in the courts.The wicked far outnumber the righteous,so that justice has become perverted.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> replied, “Look around at the nations;look and be amazed!For I am doing something in your own day,something you wouldn’t believeeven if someone told you about it.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>I am raising up the Babylonians,a cruel and violent people.They will march across the worldand conquer other lands.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>They are notorious for their crueltyand do whatever they like.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Their horses are swifter than cheetahsand fiercer than wolves at dusk.Their charioteers charge from far away.Like eagles, they swoop down to devour their prey.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“On they come, all bent on violence.Their hordes advance like a desert wind,sweeping captives ahead of them like sand.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>They scoff at kings and princesand scorn all their fortresses.They simply pile ramps of earthagainst their walls and capture them!",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>They sweep past like the windand are gone.But they are deeply guilty,for their own strength is their god.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> my God, my Holy One, you who are eternal—surely you do not plan to wipe us out?O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, our Rock, you have sent these Babylonians to correct us,to punish us for our many sins.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But you are pure and cannot stand the sight of evil.Will you wink at their treachery?Should you be silent while the wickedswallow up people more righteous than they?",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Are we only fish to be caught and killed?Are we only sea creatures that have no leader?",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Must we be strung up on their hooksand caught in their nets while they rejoice and celebrate?",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Then they will worship their netsand burn incense in front of them.“These nets are the gods who have made us rich!”they will claim.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Will you let them get away with this forever?Will they succeed forever in their heartless conquests?"
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>I will climb up to my watchtowerand stand at my guardpost.There I will wait to see what the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> saysand how he will answer my complaint.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Then the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said to me,“Write my answer plainly on tablets,so that a runner can carry the correct message to others.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>This vision is for a future time.It describes the end, and it will be fulfilled.If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently,for it will surely take place.It will not be delayed.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“Look at the proud!They trust in themselves, and their lives are crooked.But the righteous will live by their faithfulness to God.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Wealth is treacherous,and the arrogant are never at rest.They open their mouths as wide as the grave,and like death, they are never satisfied.In their greed they have gathered up many nationsand swallowed many peoples.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“But soon their captives will taunt them.They will mock them, saying,‘What sorrow awaits you thieves!Now you will get what you deserve!You’ve become rich by extortion,but how much longer can this go on?’",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Suddenly, your debtors will take action.They will turn on you and take all you have,while you stand trembling and helpless.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Because you have plundered many nations,now all the survivors will plunder you.You committed murder throughout the countrysideand filled the towns with violence.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“What sorrow awaits you who build big houseswith money gained dishonestly!You believe your wealth will buy security,putting your family’s nest beyond the reach of danger.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But by the murders you committed,you have shamed your name and forfeited your lives.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The very stones in the walls cry out against you,and the beams in the ceilings echo the complaint.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>“What sorrow awaits you who build citieswith money gained through murder and corruption!",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Has not the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies promisedthat the wealth of nations will turn to ashes?They work so hard,but all in vain!",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>For as the waters fill the sea,the earth will be filled with an awarenessof the glory of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“What sorrow awaits you who make your neighbors drunk!You force your cup on themso you can gloat over their shameful nakedness.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But soon it will be your turn to be disgraced.Come, drink and be exposed!Drink from the cup of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s judgment,and all your glory will be turned to shame.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>You cut down the forests of Lebanon.Now you will be cut down.You destroyed the wild animals,so now their terror will be yours.You committed murder throughout the countrysideand filled the towns with violence.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>“What good is an idol carved by man,or a cast image that deceives you?How foolish to trust in your own creation—a god that can’t even talk!",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>What sorrow awaits you who say to wooden idols,‘Wake up and save us!’To speechless stone images you say,‘Rise up and teach us!’Can an idol tell you what to do?They may be overlaid with gold and silver,but they are lifeless inside.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>But the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is in his holy Temple.Let all the earth be silent before him.”"

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>I have heard all about you, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.I am filled with awe by your amazing works.In this time of our deep need,help us again as you did in years gone by.And in your anger,remember your mercy.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>I see God moving across the deserts from Edom,the Holy One coming from Mount Paran.His brilliant splendor fills the heavens,and the earth is filled with his praise.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>His coming is as brilliant as the sunrise.Rays of light flash from his hands,where his awesome power is hidden.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Pestilence marches before him;plague follows close behind.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>When he stops, the earth shakes.When he looks, the nations tremble.He shatters the everlasting mountainsand levels the eternal hills.He is the Eternal One!",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>I see the people of Cushan in distress,and the nation of Midian trembling in terror.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Was it in anger, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, that you struck the riversand parted the sea?Were you displeased with them?No, you were sending your chariots of salvation!",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>You brandished your bowand your quiver of arrows.You split open the earth with flowing rivers.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The mountains watched and trembled.Onward swept the raging waters.The mighty deep cried out,lifting its hands in submission.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The sun and moon stood still in the skyas your brilliant arrows flewand your glittering spear flashed.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>You marched across the land in angerand trampled the nations in your fury.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>You went out to rescue your chosen people,to save your anointed ones.You crushed the heads of the wickedand stripped their bones from head to toe.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>With his own weapons,you destroyed the chief of thosewho rushed out like a whirlwind,thinking Israel would be easy prey.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>You trampled the sea with your horses,and the mighty waters piled high.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>I trembled inside when I heard this;my lips quivered with fear.My legs gave way beneath me,and I shook in terror.I will wait quietly for the coming daywhen disaster will strike the people who invade us.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Even though the fig trees have no blossoms,and there are no grapes on the vines;even though the olive crop fails,and the fields lie empty and barren;even though the flocks die in the fields,and the cattle barns are empty,",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>yet I will rejoice in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>!I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The Sovereign <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is my strength!He makes me as surefooted as a deer,able to tread upon the heights.(For the choir director: This prayer is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.)"
