			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>This is the message that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave to Israel through the prophet Malachi.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“I have always loved you,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.But you retort, “Really? How have you loved us?”And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> replies, “This is how I showed my love for you: I loved your ancestor Jacob,",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>but I rejected his brother, Esau, and devastated his hill country. I turned Esau’s inheritance into a desert for jackals.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Esau’s descendants in Edom may say, “We have been shattered, but we will rebuild the ruins.”But the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies replies, “They may try to rebuild, but I will demolish them again. Their country will be known as ‘The Land of Wickedness,’ and their people will be called ‘The People with Whom the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> Is Forever Angry.’",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>When you see the destruction for yourselves, you will say, ‘Truly, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s greatness reaches far beyond Israel’s borders!’”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says to the priests: “A son honors his father, and a servant respects his master. If I am your father and master, where are the honor and respect I deserve? You have shown contempt for my name!“But you ask, ‘How have we ever shown contempt for your name?’",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>“You have shown contempt by offering defiled sacrifices on my altar.“Then you ask, ‘How have we defiled the sacrifices?’“You defile them by saying the altar of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> deserves no respect.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>When you give blind animals as sacrifices, isn’t that wrong? And isn’t it wrong to offer animals that are crippled and diseased? Try giving gifts like that to your governor, and see how pleased he is!” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“Go ahead, beg God to be merciful to you! But when you bring that kind of offering, why should he show you any favor at all?” asks the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“How I wish one of you would shut the Temple doors so that these worthless sacrifices could not be offered! I am not pleased with you,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “and I will not accept your offerings.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But my name is honored by people of other nations from morning till night. All around the world they offer sweet incense and pure offerings in honor of my name. For my name is great among the nations,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>“But you dishonor my name with your actions. By bringing contemptible food, you are saying it’s all right to defile the Lord’s table.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>You say, ‘It’s too hard to serve the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>,’ and you turn up your noses at my commands,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. “Think of it! Animals that are stolen and crippled and sick are being presented as offerings! Should I accept from you such offerings as these?” asks the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“Cursed is the cheat who promises to give a fine ram from his flock but then sacrifices a defective one to the Lord. For I am a great king,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “and my name is feared among the nations!"
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>“Listen, you priests—this command is for you!",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Listen to me and make up your minds to honor my name,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “or I will bring a terrible curse against you. I will curse even the blessings you receive. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you have not taken my warning to heart.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>I will punish your descendants and splatter your faces with the manure from your festival sacrifices, and I will throw you on the manure pile.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then at last you will know it was I who sent you this warning so that my covenant with the Levites can continue,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“The purpose of my covenant with the Levites was to bring life and peace, and that is what I gave them. This required reverence from them, and they greatly revered me and stood in awe of my name.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>They passed on to the people the truth of the instructions they received from me. They did not lie or cheat; they walked with me, living good and righteous lives, and they turned many from lives of sin.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>“The words of a priest’s lips should preserve knowledge of God, and people should go to him for instruction, for the priest is the messenger of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But you priests have left God’s paths. Your instructions have caused many to stumble into sin. You have corrupted the covenant I made with the Levites,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“So I have made you despised and humiliated in the eyes of all the people. For you have not obeyed me but have shown favoritism in the way you carry out my instructions.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Are we not all children of the same Father? Are we not all created by the same God? Then why do we betray each other, violating the covenant of our ancestors?",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Judah has been unfaithful, and a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. The men of Judah have defiled the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s beloved sanctuary by marrying women who worship idols.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>May the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> cut off from the nation of Israel every last man who has done this and yet brings an offering to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Here is another thing you do. You cover the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s altar with tears, weeping and groaning because he pays no attention to your offerings and doesn’t accept them with pleasure.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>You cry out, “Why doesn’t the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> accept my worship?” I’ll tell you why! Because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> witnessed the vows you and your wife made when you were young. But you have been unfaithful to her, though she remained your faithful partner, the wife of your marriage vows.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Didn’t the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> make you one with your wife? In body and spirit you are his. And what does he want? Godly children from your union. So guard your heart; remain loyal to the wife of your youth.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>“For I hate divorce!” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. “To divorce your wife is to overwhelm her with cruelty,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. “So guard your heart; do not be unfaithful to your wife.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>You have wearied the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> with your words.“How have we wearied him?” you ask.You have wearied him by saying that all who do evil are good in the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>’s sight, and he is pleased with them. You have wearied him by asking, “Where is the God of justice?”"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>“Look! I am sending my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. Then the Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to his Temple. The messenger of the covenant, whom you look for so eagerly, is surely coming,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“But who will be able to endure it when he comes? Who will be able to stand and face him when he appears? For he will be like a blazing fire that refines metal, or like a strong soap that bleaches clothes.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>He will sit like a refiner of silver, burning away the dross. He will purify the Levites, refining them like gold and silver, so that they may once again offer acceptable sacrifices to the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then once more the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> will accept the offerings brought to him by the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as he did in the past.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“At that time I will put you on trial. I am eager to witness against all sorcerers and adulterers and liars. I will speak against those who cheat employees of their wages, who oppress widows and orphans, or who deprive the foreigners living among you of justice, for these people do not fear me,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>“I am the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and I do not change. That is why you descendants of Jacob are not already destroyed.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Ever since the days of your ancestors, you have scorned my decrees and failed to obey them. Now return to me, and I will return to you,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.“But you ask, ‘How can we return when we have never gone away?’",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“Should people cheat God? Yet you have cheated me!“But you ask, ‘What do you mean? When did we ever cheat you?’“You have cheated me of the tithes and offerings due to me.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>You are under a curse, for your whole nation has been cheating me.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my Temple. If you do,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, “I will open the windows of heaven for you. I will pour out a blessing so great you won’t have enough room to take it in! Try it! Put me to the test!",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Your crops will be abundant, for I will guard them from insects and disease. Your grapes will not fall from the vine before they are ripe,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>“Then all nations will call you blessed, for your land will be such a delight,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>“You have said terrible things about me,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.“But you say, ‘What do you mean? What have we said against you?’",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“You have said, ‘What’s the use of serving God? What have we gained by obeying his commands or by trying to show the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies that we are sorry for our sins?",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>From now on we will call the arrogant blessed. For those who do evil get rich, and those who dare God to punish them suffer no harm.’”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Then those who feared the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> spoke with each other, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> listened to what they said. In his presence, a scroll of remembrance was written to record the names of those who feared him and always thought about the honor of his name.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“They will be my people,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. “On the day when I act in judgment, they will be my own special treasure. I will spare them as a father spares an obedient child.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Then you will again see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.”"
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies says, “The day of judgment is coming, burning like a furnace. On that day the arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw. They will be consumed—roots, branches, and all.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>“But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in his wings. And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>On the day when I act, you will tread upon the wicked as if they were dust under your feet,” says the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“Remember to obey the Law of Moses, my servant—all the decrees and regulations that I gave him on Mount Sinai for all Israel.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“Look, I am sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> arrives.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>His preaching will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse.”"
