		"1": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span><sup class=\"versenum mid-line\">1-2 </sup>The Word was first,the Word present to God,God present to the Word.The Word was God,in readiness for God from day one.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-5 </sup>Everything was created through him;nothing—not one thing!—came into being without him.What came into existence was Life,and the Life was Light to live by.The Life-Light blazed out of the darkness;the darkness couldn’t put it out.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-8 </sup>There once was a man, his name John, sent by God to point out the way to the Life-Light. He came to show everyone where to look, who to believe in. John was not himself the Light; he was there to show the way to the Light.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-13 </sup>The Life-Light was the real thing:Every person entering Lifehe brings into Light.He was in the world,the world was there through him,and yet the world didn’t even notice.He came to his own people,but they didn’t want him.But whoever did want him,who believed he was who he claimedand would do what he said,He made to be their true selves,their child-of-God selves.These are the God-begotten,not blood-begotten,not flesh-begotten,not sex-begotten.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>The Word became flesh and blood,and moved into the neighborhood.We saw the glory with our own eyes,the one-of-a-kind glory,like Father, like Son,Generous inside and out,true from start to finish.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>John pointed him out and called, “This is the One! The One I told you was coming after me but in fact was ahead of me. He has always been ahead of me, has always had the first word.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-18 </sup>We all live off his generous bounty,gift after gift after gift.We got the basics from Moses,and then this exuberant giving and receiving,This endless knowing and understanding—all this came through Jesus, the Messiah.No one has ever seen God,not so much as a glimpse.This one-of-a-kind God-Expression,who exists at the very heart of the Father,has made him plain as day.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-20 </sup>When Jews from Jerusalem sent a group of priests and officials to ask John who he was, he was completely honest. He didn’t evade the question. He told the plain truth: “I am not the Messiah.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>They pressed him, “Who, then? Elijah?”“I am not.”“The Prophet?”“No.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Exasperated, they said, “Who, then? We need an answer for those who sent us. Tell us something—anything!—about yourself.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>“I’m thunder in the desert: ‘Make the road straight for God!’ I’m doing what the prophet Isaiah preached.”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>Those sent to question him were from the Pharisee party. Now they had a question of their own: “If you’re neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why do you baptize?”",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26-27 </sup>John answered, “I only baptize using water. A person you don’t recognize has taken his stand in your midst. He comes after me, but he is not in second place to me. I’m not even worthy to hold his coat for him.”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>These conversations took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing at the time.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29-31 </sup>The very next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and yelled out, “Here he is, God’s Passover Lamb! He forgives the sins of the world! This is the man I’ve been talking about, ‘the One who comes after me but is really ahead of me.’ I knew nothing about who he was—only this: that my task has been to get Israel ready to recognize him as the God-Revealer. That is why I came here baptizing with water, giving you a good bath and scrubbing sins from your life so you can get a fresh start with God.”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32-34 </sup>John clinched his witness with this: “I watched the Spirit, like a dove flying down out of the sky, making himself at home in him. I repeat, I know nothing about him except this: The One who authorized me to baptize with water told me, ‘The One on whom you see the Spirit come down and stay, this One will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ That’s exactly what I saw happen, and I’m telling you, there’s no question about it: <i>This</i> is the Son of God.”",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35-36 </sup>The next day John was back at his post with two disciples, who were watching. He looked up, saw Jesus walking nearby, and said, “Here he is, God’s Passover Lamb.”",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37-38 </sup>The two disciples heard him and went after Jesus. Jesus looked over his shoulder and said to them, “What are you after?”They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>He replied, “Come along and see for yourself.”They came, saw where he was living, and ended up staying with him for the day. It was late afternoon when this happened.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40-42 </sup>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John’s witness and followed Jesus. The first thing he did after finding where Jesus lived was find his own brother, Simon, telling him, “We’ve found the Messiah” (that is, “Christ”). He immediately led him to Jesus.Jesus took one look up and said, “You’re John’s son, Simon? From now on your name is Cephas” (or Peter, which means “Rock”).",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43-44 </sup>The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. When he got there, he ran across Philip and said, “Come, follow me.” (Philip’s hometown was Bethsaida, the same as Andrew and Peter.)",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45-46 </sup>Philip went and found Nathanael and told him, “We’ve found the One Moses wrote of in the Law, the One preached by the prophets. It’s <i>Jesus</i>, Joseph’s son, the one from Nazareth!” Nathanael said, “Nazareth? You’ve got to be kidding.”But Philip said, “Come, see for yourself.”",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>When Jesus saw him coming he said, “There’s a real Israelite, not a false bone in his body.”",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>Nathanael said, “Where did you get that idea? You don’t know me.”Jesus answered, “One day, long before Philip called you here, I saw you under the fig tree.”",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>Nathanael exclaimed, “Rabbi! You are the Son of God, the King of Israel!”",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50-51 </sup>Jesus said, “You’ve become a believer simply because I say I saw you one day sitting under the fig tree? You haven’t seen anything yet! Before this is over you’re going to see heaven open and God’s angels descending to the Son of Man and ascending again.”"

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>Three days later there was a wedding in the village of Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there. Jesus and his disciples were guests also. When they started running low on wine at the wedding banquet, Jesus’ mother told him, “They’re just about out of wine.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Jesus said, “Is that any of our business, Mother—yours or mine? This isn’t my time. Don’t push me.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>She went ahead anyway, telling the servants, “Whatever he tells you, do it.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>Six stoneware water pots were there, used by the Jews for ritual washings. Each held twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus ordered the servants, “Fill the pots with water.” And they filled them to the brim.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“Now fill your pitchers and take them to the host,” Jesus said, and they did.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>When the host tasted the water that had become wine (he didn’t know what had just happened but the servants, of course, knew), he called out to the bridegroom, “Everybody I know begins with their finest wines and after the guests have had their fill brings in the cheap stuff. But you’ve saved the best till now!”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>This act in Cana of Galilee was the first sign Jesus gave, the first glimpse of his glory. And his disciples believed in him.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>After this he went down to Capernaum along with his mother, brothers, and disciples, and stayed several days.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>When the Passover Feast, celebrated each spring by the Jews, was about to take place, Jesus traveled up to Jerusalem. He found the Temple teeming with people selling cattle and sheep and doves. The loan sharks were also there in full strength.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-17 </sup>Jesus put together a whip out of strips of leather and chased them out of the Temple, stampeding the sheep and cattle, upending the tables of the loan sharks, spilling coins left and right. He told the dove merchants, “Get your things out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a shopping mall!” That’s when his disciples remembered the Scripture, “Zeal for your house consumes me.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-19 </sup>But the Jews were upset. They asked, “What credentials can you present to justify this?” Jesus answered, “Tear down this Temple and in three days I’ll put it back together.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-22 </sup>They were indignant: “It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and you’re going to rebuild it in three days?” But Jesus was talking about his body as the Temple. Later, after he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered he had said this. They then put two and two together and believed both what was written in Scripture and what Jesus had said.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-25 </sup>During the time he was in Jerusalem, those days of the Passover Feast, many people noticed the signs he was displaying and, seeing they pointed straight to God, entrusted their lives to him. But Jesus didn’t entrust his life to them. He knew them inside and out, knew how untrustworthy they were. He didn’t need any help in seeing right through them."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>There was a man of the Pharisee sect, Nicodemus, a prominent leader among the Jews. Late one night he visited Jesus and said, “Rabbi, we all know you’re a teacher straight from God. No one could do all the God-pointing, God-revealing acts you do if God weren’t in on it.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Jesus said, “You’re absolutely right. Take it from me: Unless a person is born from above, it’s not possible to see what I’m pointing to—to God’s kingdom.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“How can anyone,” said Nicodemus, “be born who has already been born and grown up? You can’t re-enter your mother’s womb and be born again. What are you saying with this ‘born-from-above’ talk?”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>Jesus said, “You’re not listening. Let me say it again. Unless a person submits to this original creation—the ‘wind-hovering-over-the-water’ creation, the invisible moving the visible, a baptism into a new life—it’s not possible to enter God’s kingdom. When you look at a baby, it’s just that: a body you can look at and touch. But the person who takes shape within is formed by something you can’t see and touch—the Spirit—and becomes a living spirit.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-8 </sup>“So don’t be so surprised when I tell you that you have to be ‘born from above’—out of this world, so to speak. You know well enough how the wind blows this way and that. You hear it rustling through the trees, but you have no idea where it comes from or where it’s headed next. That’s the way it is with everyone ‘born from above’ by the wind of God, the Spirit of God.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Nicodemus asked, “What do you mean by this? How does this happen?”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-12 </sup>Jesus said, “You’re a respected teacher of Israel and you don’t know these basics? Listen carefully. I’m speaking sober truth to you. I speak only of what I know by experience; I give witness only to what I have seen with my own eyes. There is nothing secondhand here, no hearsay. Yet instead of facing the evidence and accepting it, you procrastinate with questions. If I tell you things that are plain as the hand before your face and you don’t believe me, what use is there in telling you of things you can’t see, the things of God?",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-15 </sup>“No one has ever gone up into the presence of God except the One who came down from that Presence, the Son of Man. In the same way that Moses lifted the serpent in the desert so people could have something to see and then believe, it is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up—and everyone who looks up to him, trusting and expectant, will gain a real life, eternal life.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-18 </sup>“This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn’t go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again. Anyone who trusts in him is acquitted; anyone who refuses to trust him has long since been under the death sentence without knowing it. And why? Because of that person’s failure to believe in the one-of-a-kind Son of God when introduced to him.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-21 </sup>“This is the crisis we’re in: God-light streamed into the world, but men and women everywhere ran for the darkness. They went for the darkness because they were not really interested in pleasing God. Everyone who makes a practice of doing evil, addicted to denial and illusion, hates God-light and won’t come near it, fearing a painful exposure. But anyone working and living in truth and reality welcomes God-light so the work can be seen for the God-work it is.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-26 </sup>After this conversation, Jesus went on with his disciples into the Judean countryside and relaxed with them there. He was also baptizing. At the same time, John was baptizing over at Aenon near Salim, where water was abundant. This was before John was thrown into jail. John’s disciples got into an argument with the establishment Jews over the nature of baptism. They came to John and said, “Rabbi, you know the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan? The one you authorized with your witness? Well, he’s now competing with us. He’s baptizing, too, and everyone’s going to him instead of us.”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27-29 </sup>John answered, “It’s not possible for a person to succeed—I’m talking about <i>eternal</i> success—without heaven’s help. You yourselves were there when I made it public that I was not the Messiah but simply the one sent ahead of him to get things ready. The one who gets the bride is, by definition, the bridegroom. And the bridegroom’s friend, his ‘best man’—that’s me—in place at his side where he can hear every word, is genuinely happy. How could he be jealous when he knows that the wedding is finished and the marriage is off to a good start?",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29-30 </sup>“That’s why my cup is running over. This is the assigned moment for him to move into the center, while I slip off to the sidelines.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31-33 </sup>“The One who comes from above is head and shoulders over other messengers from God. The earthborn is earthbound and speaks earth language; the heavenborn is in a league of his own. He sets out the evidence of what he saw and heard in heaven. No one wants to deal with these facts. But anyone who examines this evidence will come to stake his life on this: that God himself is the truth.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34-36 </sup>“The One that God sent speaks God’s words. And don’t think he rations out the Spirit in bits and pieces. The Father loves the Son extravagantly. He turned everything over to him so he could give it away—a lavish distribution of gifts. That is why whoever accepts and trusts the Son gets in on everything, life complete and forever! And that is also why the person who avoids and distrusts the Son is in the dark and doesn’t see life. All he experiences of God is darkness, and an angry darkness at that.”"
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>Jesus realized that the Pharisees were keeping count of the baptisms that he and John performed (although his disciples, not Jesus, did the actual baptizing). They had posted the score that Jesus was ahead, turning him and John into rivals in the eyes of the people. So Jesus left the Judean countryside and went back to Galilee.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-6 </sup>To get there, he had to pass through Samaria. He came into Sychar, a Samaritan village that bordered the field Jacob had given his son Joseph. Jacob’s well was still there. Jesus, worn out by the trip, sat down at the well. It was noon.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-8 </sup>A woman, a Samaritan, came to draw water. Jesus said, “Would you give me a drink of water?” (His disciples had gone to the village to buy food for lunch.)",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>The Samaritan woman, taken aback, asked, “How come you, a Jew, are asking me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?” (Jews in those days wouldn’t be caught dead talking to Samaritans.)",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Jesus answered, “If you knew the generosity of God and who I am, you would be asking <i>me</i> for a drink, and I would give you fresh, living water.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>The woman said, “Sir, you don’t even have a bucket to draw with, and this well is deep. So how are you going to get this ‘living water’? Are you a better man than our ancestor Jacob, who dug this well and drank from it, he and his sons and livestock, and passed it down to us?”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>Jesus said, “Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again and again. Anyone who drinks the water I give will never thirst—not ever. The water I give will be an artesian spring within, gushing fountains of endless life.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The woman said, “Sir, give me this water so I won’t ever get thirsty, won’t ever have to come back to this well again!”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>He said, “Go call your husband and then come back.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-18 </sup>“I have no husband,” she said.“That’s nicely put: ‘I have no husband.’ You’ve had five husbands, and the man you’re living with now isn’t even your husband. You spoke the truth there, sure enough.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-20 </sup>“Oh, so you’re a prophet! Well, tell me this: Our ancestors worshiped God at this mountain, but you Jews insist that Jerusalem is the only place for worship, right?”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-23 </sup>“Believe me, woman, the time is coming when you Samaritans will worship the Father neither here at this mountain nor there in Jerusalem. You worship guessing in the dark; we Jews worship in the clear light of day. God’s way of salvation is made available through the Jews. But the time is coming—it has, in fact, come—when what you’re called will not matter and where you go to worship will not matter.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-24 </sup>“It’s who you are and the way you live that count before God. Your worship must engage your spirit in the pursuit of truth. That’s the kind of people the Father is out looking for: those who are simply and honestly <i>themselves</i> before him in their worship. God is sheer being itself—Spirit. Those who worship him must do it out of their very being, their spirits, their true selves, in adoration.”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>The woman said, “I don’t know about that. I do know that the Messiah is coming. When he arrives, we’ll get the whole story.”",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>“I am he,” said Jesus. “You don’t have to wait any longer or look any further.”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Just then his disciples came back. They were shocked. They couldn’t believe he was talking with that kind of a woman. No one said what they were all thinking, but their faces showed it.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28-30 </sup>The woman took the hint and left. In her confusion she left her water pot. Back in the village she told the people, “Come see a man who knew all about the things I did, who knows me inside and out. Do you think this could be the Messiah?” And they went out to see for themselves.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>In the meantime, the disciples pressed him, “Rabbi, eat. Aren’t you going to eat?”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>He told them, “I have food to eat you know nothing about.”",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>The disciples were puzzled. “Who could have brought him food?”",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34-35 </sup>Jesus said, “The food that keeps me going is that I do the will of the One who sent me, finishing the work he started. As you look around right now, wouldn’t you say that in about four months it will be time to harvest? Well, I’m telling you to open your eyes and take a good look at what’s right in front of you. These Samaritan fields are ripe. It’s harvest time!",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36-38 </sup>“The Harvester isn’t waiting. He’s taking his pay, gathering in this grain that’s ripe for eternal life. Now the Sower is arm in arm with the Harvester, triumphant. That’s the truth of the saying, ‘This one sows, that one harvests.’ I sent you to harvest a field you never worked. Without lifting a finger, you have walked in on a field worked long and hard by others.”",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39-42 </sup>Many of the Samaritans from that village committed themselves to him because of the woman’s witness: “He knew all about the things I did. He knows me inside and out!” They asked him to stay on, so Jesus stayed two days. A lot more people entrusted their lives to him when they heard what he had to say. They said to the woman, “We’re no longer taking this on your say-so. We’ve heard it for ourselves and know it for sure. He’s the Savior of the world!”",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43-45 </sup>After the two days he left for Galilee. Now, Jesus knew well from experience that a prophet is not respected in the place where he grew up. So when he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, but only because they were impressed with what he had done in Jerusalem during the Passover Feast, not that they really had a clue about who he was or what he was up to.",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46-48 </sup>Now he was back in Cana of Galilee, the place where he made the water into wine. Meanwhile in Capernaum, there was a certain official from the king’s court whose son was sick. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and asked that he come down and heal his son, who was on the brink of death. Jesus put him off: “Unless you people are dazzled by a miracle, you refuse to believe.”",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>But the court official wouldn’t be put off. “Come down! It’s life or death for my son.”",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50-51 </sup>Jesus simply replied, “Go home. Your son lives.”The man believed the bare word Jesus spoke and headed home. On his way back, his servants intercepted him and announced, “Your son lives!”",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52-53 </sup>He asked them what time he began to get better. They said, “The fever broke yesterday afternoon at one o’clock.” The father knew that that was the very moment Jesus had said, “Your son lives.”",
			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53-54 </sup>That clinched it. Not only he but his entire household believed. This was now the second sign Jesus gave after having come from Judea into Galilee."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-6 </sup>Soon another Feast came around and Jesus was back in Jerusalem. Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there was a pool, in Hebrew called <i>Bethesda</i>, with five alcoves. Hundreds of sick people—blind, crippled, paralyzed—were in these alcoves. One man had been an invalid there for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him stretched out by the pool and knew how long he had been there, he said, “Do you want to get well?”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The sick man said, “Sir, when the water is stirred, I don’t have anybody to put me in the pool. By the time I get there, somebody else is already in.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>Jesus said, “Get up, take your bedroll, start walking.” The man was healed on the spot. He picked up his bedroll and walked off.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>That day happened to be the Sabbath. The Jews stopped the healed man and said, “It’s the Sabbath. You can’t carry your bedroll around. It’s against the rules.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But he told them, “The man who made me well told me to. He said, ‘Take your bedroll and start walking.’”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>They asked, “Who gave you the order to take it up and start walking?” But the healed man didn’t know, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>A little later Jesus found him in the Temple and said, “You look wonderful! You’re well! Don’t return to a sinning life or something worse might happen.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>The man went back and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. That is why the Jews were out to get Jesus—because he did this kind of thing on the Sabbath.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>But Jesus defended himself. “My Father is working straight through, even on the Sabbath. So am I.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>That really set them off. The Jews were now not only out to expose him; they were out to <i>kill</i> him. Not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was calling God his own Father, putting himself on a level with God.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-20 </sup>So Jesus explained himself at length. “I’m telling you this straight. The Son can’t independently do a thing, only what he sees the Father doing. What the Father does, the Son does. The Father loves the Son and includes him in everything he is doing.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-23 </sup>“But you haven’t seen the half of it yet, for in the same way that the Father raises the dead and creates life, so does the Son. The Son gives life to anyone he chooses. Neither he nor the Father shuts anyone out. The Father handed all authority to judge over to the Son so that the Son will be honored equally with the Father. Anyone who dishonors the Son, dishonors the Father, for it was the Father’s decision to put the Son in the place of honor.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>“It’s urgent that you listen carefully to this: Anyone here who believes what I am saying right now and aligns himself with the Father, who has in fact put me in charge, has at this very moment the real, lasting life and is no longer condemned to be an outsider. This person has taken a giant step from the world of the dead to the world of the living.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-27 </sup>“It’s urgent that you get this right: The time has arrived—I mean right now!—when dead men and women will hear the voice of the Son of God and, hearing, will come alive. Just as the Father has life in himself, he has conferred on the Son life in himself. And he has given him the authority, simply because he is the Son of Man, to decide and carry out matters of Judgment.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28-29 </sup>“Don’t act so surprised at all this. The time is coming when everyone dead and buried will hear his voice. Those who have lived the right way will walk out into a resurrection Life; those who have lived the wrong way, into a resurrection Judgment.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30-33 </sup>“I can’t do a solitary thing on my own: I listen, then I decide. You can trust my decision because I’m not out to get my own way but only to carry out orders. If I were simply speaking on my own account, it would be an empty, self-serving witness. But an independent witness confirms me, the most reliable Witness of all. Furthermore, you all saw and heard John, and he gave expert and reliable testimony about me, didn’t he?",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34-38 </sup>“But my purpose is not to get your vote, and not to appeal to mere human testimony. I’m speaking to you this way so that you will be saved. John was a torch, blazing and bright, and you were glad enough to dance for an hour or so in his bright light. But the witness that really confirms me far exceeds John’s witness. It’s the work the Father gave me to complete. These very tasks, as I go about completing them, confirm that the Father, in fact, sent me. The Father who sent me, confirmed me. And you missed it.

It was nearly time for the Feast of Passover, kept annually by the Jews.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>When Jesus looked out and saw that a large crowd had arrived, he said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread to feed these people?” He said this to stretch Philip’s faith. He already knew what he was going to do.",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>One of the disciples—it was Andrew, brother to Simon Peter—said, “There’s a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish. But that’s a drop in the bucket for a crowd like this.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-11 </sup>Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” There was a nice carpet of green grass in this place. They sat down, about five thousand of them. Then Jesus took the bread and, having given thanks, gave it to those who were seated. He did the same with the fish. All ate as much as they wanted.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>When the people had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples, “Gather the leftovers so nothing is wasted.” They went to work and filled twelve large baskets with leftovers from the five barley loaves.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>The people realized that God was at work among them in what Jesus had just done. They said, “This is the Prophet for sure, God’s Prophet right here in Galilee!” Jesus saw that in their enthusiasm, they were about to grab him and make him king, so he slipped off and went back up the mountain to be by himself.",

It had grown quite dark and Jesus had not yet returned. A huge wind blew up, churning the sea. They were maybe three or four miles out when they saw Jesus walking on the sea, quite near the boat. They were scared senseless, but he reassured them, “It’s me. It’s all right. Don’t be afraid.” So they took him on board. In no time they reached land—the exact spot they were headed to.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-24 </sup>The next day the crowd that was left behind realized that there had been only one boat, and that Jesus had not gotten into it with his disciples. They had seen them go off without him. By now boats from Tiberias had pulled up near where they had eaten the bread blessed by the Master. So when the crowd realized he was gone and wasn’t coming back, they piled into the Tiberias boats and headed for Capernaum, looking for Jesus.",

The Bread of God came down out of heaven and is giving life to the world.”",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>They jumped at that: “Master, give us this bread, now and forever!”",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35-38 </sup>Jesus said, “I am the Bread of Life. The person who aligns with me hungers no more and thirsts no more, ever. I have told you this explicitly because even though you have seen me in action, you don’t really believe me. Every person the Father gives me eventually comes running to me.

My part is to put them on their feet alive and whole at the completion of time.”",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41-42 </sup>At this, because he said, “I am the Bread that came down from heaven,” the Jews started arguing over him: “Isn’t this the son of Joseph?

He draws people to me—that’s the only way you’ll ever come. Only then do I do my work, putting people together, setting them on their feet, ready for the End. This is what the prophets meant when they wrote, ‘And then they will all be personally taught by God.’ Anyone who has spent any time at all listening to the Father, really listening and therefore learning, comes to me to be taught personally—to see it with his own eyes, hear it with his own ears, from me, since I have it firsthand from the Father. No one has seen the Father except the One who has his Being alongside the Father—and you can see <i>me</i>.",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47-51 </sup>“I’m telling you the most solemn and sober truth now: Whoever believes in me has real life, eternal life. I am the Bread of Life.

I am the Bread—living Bread!—who came down out of heaven. Anyone who eats this Bread will live—and forever! The Bread that I present to the world so that it can eat and live is myself, this flesh-and-blood self.”",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52 </sup>At this, the Jews started fighting among themselves: “How can this man serve up his flesh for a meal?”",
			"53": "<sup class=\"versenum\">53-58 </sup>But Jesus didn’t give an inch. “Only insofar as you eat and drink flesh and blood, the flesh and blood of the Son of Man, do you have life within you. The one who brings a hearty appetite to this eating and drinking has eternal life and will be fit and ready for the Final Day. My flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. By eating my flesh and drinking my blood you enter into me and I into you. In the same way that the fully alive Father sent me here and I live because of him, so the one who makes a meal of me lives because of me. This is the Bread from heaven. Your ancestors ate bread and later died. Whoever eats this Bread will live always.”",
			"59": "<sup class=\"versenum\">59 </sup>He said these things while teaching in the meeting place in Capernaum.",
			"60": "<sup class=\"versenum\">60 </sup>Many among his disciples heard this and said, “This is tough teaching, too tough to swallow.”",
			"61": "<sup class=\"versenum\">61-65 </sup>Jesus sensed that his disciples were having a hard time with this and said, “Does this throw you completely? What would happen if you saw the Son of Man ascending to where he came from? The Spirit can make life. Sheer muscle and willpower don’t make anything happen. Every word I’ve spoken to you is a Spirit-word, and so it is life-making. But some of you are resisting, refusing to have any part in this.” (Jesus knew from the start that some weren’t going to risk themselves with him. He knew also who would betray him.) He went on to say, “This is why I told you earlier that no one is capable of coming to me on his own. You get to me only as a gift from the Father.”",
			"66": "<sup class=\"versenum\">66-67 </sup>After this a lot of his disciples left. They no longer wanted to be associated with him. Then Jesus gave the Twelve their chance: “Do you also want to leave?”",
			"68": "<sup class=\"versenum\">68-69 </sup>Peter replied, “Master, to whom would we go? You have the words of real life, eternal life. We’ve already committed ourselves, confident that you are the Holy One of God.”",

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Later Jesus was going about his business in Galilee. He didn’t want to travel in Judea because the Jews there were looking for a chance to kill him. It was near the time of Tabernacles, a feast observed annually by the Jews.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-5 </sup>His brothers said, “Why don’t you leave here and go up to the Feast so your disciples can get a good look at the works you do? No one who intends to be publicly known does everything behind the scenes. If you’re serious about what you are doing, come out in the open and show the world.” His brothers were pushing him like this because they didn’t believe in him either.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-8 </sup>Jesus came back at them, “Don’t crowd me. This isn’t my time. It’s your time—it’s <i>always</i> your time; you have nothing to lose. The world has nothing against you, but it’s up in arms against me. It’s against me because I expose the evil behind its pretensions. You go ahead, go up to the Feast. Don’t wait for me. I’m not ready. It’s not the right time for me.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-11 </sup>He said this and stayed on in Galilee. But later, after his family had gone up to the Feast, he also went. But he kept out of the way, careful not to draw attention to himself. The Jews were already out looking for him, asking around, “Where is that man?”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>There was a lot of contentious talk about him circulating through the crowds. Some were saying, “He’s a good man.” But others said, “Not so. He’s selling snake oil.” This kind of talk went on in guarded whispers because of the intimidating Jewish leaders.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>With the Feast already half over, Jesus showed up in the Temple, teaching. The Jews were impressed, but puzzled: “How does he know so much without being schooled?”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-19 </sup>Jesus said, “I didn’t make this up. What I teach comes from the One who sent me. Anyone who wants to do his will can test this teaching and know whether it’s from God or whether I’m making it up. A person making things up tries to make himself look good. But someone trying to honor the one who sent him sticks to the facts and doesn’t tamper with reality. It was Moses, wasn’t it, who gave you God’s Law? But none of you are living it. So why are you trying to kill me?”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The crowd said, “You’re crazy! Who’s trying to kill you? You’re demon-possessed.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-24 </sup>Jesus said, “I did one miraculous thing a few months ago, and you’re still standing around getting all upset, wondering what I’m up to. Moses prescribed circumcision—originally it came not from Moses but from his ancestors—and so you circumcise a man, dealing with one part of his body, even if it’s the Sabbath. You do this in order to preserve one item in the Law of Moses. So why are you upset with me because I made a man’s whole body well on the Sabbath? Don’t be nitpickers; use your head—and heart!—to discern what is right, to test what is authentically right.”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-27 </sup>That’s when some of the people of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this the one they were out to kill? And here he is out in the open, saying whatever he pleases, and no one is stopping him. Could it be that the rulers know that he is, in fact, the Messiah? And yet we know where this man came from. The Messiah is going to come out of nowhere. Nobody is going to know where he comes from.”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28-29 </sup>That provoked Jesus, who was teaching in the Temple, to cry out, “Yes, you think you know me and where I’m from, but that’s not where I’m from. I didn’t set myself up in business. My true origin is in the One who sent me, and you don’t know him at all. I come from him—that’s how I know him. He sent me here.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30-31 </sup>They were looking for a way to arrest him, but not a hand was laid on him because it wasn’t yet God’s time. Many from the crowd committed themselves in faith to him, saying, “Will the Messiah, when he comes, provide better or more convincing evidence than this?”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32-34 </sup>The Pharisees, alarmed at this seditious undertow going through the crowd, teamed up with the high priests and sent their police to arrest him. Jesus rebuffed them: “I am with you only a short time. Then I go on to the One who sent me. You will look for me, but you won’t find me. Where I am, you can’t come.”",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35-36 </sup>The Jews put their heads together. “Where do you think he is going that we won’t be able to find him? Do you think he is about to travel to the Greek world to teach the Jews? What is he talking about, anyway: ‘You will look for me, but you won’t find me,’ and ‘Where I am, you can’t come’?”",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37-39 </sup>On the final and climactic day of the Feast, Jesus took his stand. He cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Rivers of living water will brim and spill out of the depths of anyone who believes in me this way, just as the Scripture says.” (He said this in regard to the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive. The Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40-44 </sup>Those in the crowd who heard these words were saying, “This has to be the Prophet.” Others said, “He is the Messiah!” But others were saying, “The Messiah doesn’t come from Galilee, does he? Don’t the Scriptures tell us that the Messiah comes from David’s line and from Bethlehem, David’s village?” So there was a split in the crowd over him. Some went so far as wanting to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him.",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>That’s when the Temple police reported back to the high priests and Pharisees, who demanded, “Why didn’t you bring him with you?”",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>The police answered, “Have you heard the way he talks? We’ve never heard anyone speak like this man.”",
			"47": "<sup class=\"versenum\">47-49 </sup>The Pharisees said, “Are you carried away like the rest of the rabble? You don’t see any of the leaders believing in him, do you? Or any from the Pharisees? It’s only this crowd, ignorant of God’s Law, that is taken in by him—and damned.”",
			"50": "<sup class=\"versenum\">50-51 </sup>Nicodemus, the man who had come to Jesus earlier and was both a ruler and a Pharisee, spoke up. “Does our Law decide about a man’s guilt without first listening to him and finding out what he is doing?”",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-6 </sup>The religion scholars and Pharisees led in a woman who had been caught in an act of adultery. They stood her in plain sight of everyone and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught red-handed in the act of adultery. Moses, in the Law, gives orders to stone such persons. What do you say?” They were trying to trap him into saying something incriminating so they could bring charges against him.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-8 </sup>Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger in the dirt. They kept at him, badgering him. He straightened up and said, “The sinless one among you, go first: Throw the stone.” Bending down again, he wrote some more in the dirt.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>Hearing that, they walked away, one after another, beginning with the oldest. The woman was left alone. Jesus stood up and spoke to her. “Woman, where are they? Does no one condemn you?”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>“No one, Master.”“Neither do I,” said Jesus. “Go on your way. From now on, don’t sin.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Jesus once again addressed them: “I am the world’s Light. No one who follows me stumbles around in the darkness. I provide plenty of light to live in.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>The Pharisees objected, “All we have is your word on this. We need more than this to go on.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-18 </sup>Jesus replied, “You’re right that you only have my word. But you can depend on it being true. I know where I’ve come from and where I go next. You don’t know where I’m from or where I’m headed. You decide according to what you can see and touch. I don’t make judgments like that. But even if I did, my judgment would be true because I wouldn’t make it out of the narrowness of my experience but in the largeness of the One who sent me, the Father. That fulfills the conditions set down in God’s Law: that you can count on the testimony of two witnesses. And that is what you have: You have my word and you have the word of the Father who sent me.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>They said, “Where is this so-called Father of yours?”Jesus said, “You’re looking right at me and you don’t see me. How do you expect to see the Father? If you knew me, you would at the same time know the Father.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>He gave this speech in the Treasury while teaching in the Temple. No one arrested him because his time wasn’t yet up.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Then he went over the same ground again. “I’m leaving and you are going to look for me, but you’re missing God in this and are headed for a dead end. There is no way you can come with me.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>The Jews said, “So, is he going to kill himself? Is that what he means by ‘You can’t come with me’?”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-24 </sup>Jesus said, “You’re tied down to the mundane; I’m in touch with what is beyond your horizons. You live in terms of what you see and touch. I’m living on other terms. I told you that you were missing God in all this. You’re at a dead end. If you won’t believe I am who I say I am, you’re at the dead end of sins. You’re missing God in your lives.”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-26 </sup>They said to him, “Just who are you anyway?”Jesus said, “What I’ve said from the start. I have so many things to say that concern you, judgments to make that affect you, but if you don’t accept the trustworthiness of the One who commanded my words and acts, none of it matters. That is who you are questioning—not me but the One who sent me.”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27-29 </sup>They still didn’t get it, didn’t realize that he was referring to the Father. So Jesus tried again. “When you raise up the Son of Man, then you will know who I am—that I’m not making this up, but speaking only what the Father taught me. The One who sent me stays with me. He doesn’t abandon me. He sees how much joy I take in pleasing him.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>When he put it in these terms, many people decided to believe.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31-32 </sup>Then Jesus turned to the Jews who had claimed to believe in him. “If you stick with this, living out what I tell you, you are my disciples for sure. Then you will experience for yourselves the truth, and the truth will free you.”",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Surprised, they said, “But we’re descendants of Abraham. We’ve never been slaves to anyone. How can you say, ‘The truth will free you’?”",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34-38 </sup>Jesus said, “I tell you most solemnly that anyone who chooses a life of sin is trapped in a dead-end life and is, in fact, a slave. A slave is a transient, who can’t come and go at will. The Son, though, has an established position, the run of the house. So if the Son sets you free, you are free through and through. I know you are Abraham’s descendants. But I also know that you are trying to kill me because my message hasn’t yet penetrated your thick skulls. I’m talking about things I have seen while keeping company with the Father, and you just go on doing what you have heard from your father.”",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39-41 </sup>They were indignant. “Our father is Abraham!”Jesus said, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would have been doing the things Abraham did. And yet here you are trying to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth he got straight from God! Abraham never did that sort of thing. You persist in repeating the works of your father.”They said, “We’re not bastards. We have a legitimate father: the one and only God.”",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42-47 </sup>“If God were your father,” said Jesus, “you would love me, for I came from God and arrived here. I didn’t come on my own. He sent me. Why can’t you understand one word I say? Here’s why: You can’t handle it. You’re from your father, the Devil, and all you want to do is please him. He was a killer from the very start. He couldn’t stand the truth because there wasn’t a shred of truth in him. When the Liar speaks, he makes it up out of his lying nature and fills the world with lies. I arrive on the scene, tell you the plain truth, and you refuse to have a thing to do with me. Can any one of you convict me of a single misleading word, a single sinful act? But if I’m telling the truth, why don’t you believe me? Anyone on God’s side listens to God’s words. This is why you’re not listening—because you’re not on God’s side.”",
			"48": "<sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>The Jews then said, “That clinches it. We were right all along when we called you a Samaritan and said you were crazy—demon-possessed!”",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49-51 </sup>Jesus said, “I’m not crazy. I simply honor my Father, while you dishonor me. I am not trying to get anything for myself. God intends something gloriously grand here and is making the decisions that will bring it about. I say this with absolute confidence. If you practice what I’m telling you, you’ll never have to look death in the face.”",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52-53 </sup>At this point the Jews said, “Now we <i>know</i> you’re crazy. Abraham died. The prophets died. And you show up saying, ‘If you practice what I’m telling you, you’ll never have to face death, not even a taste.’ Are you greater than Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you think you are!”",
			"54": "<sup class=\"versenum\">54-56 </sup>Jesus said, “If I turned the spotlight on myself, it wouldn’t amount to anything. But my Father, the same One you say is your Father, put me here at this time and place of splendor. You haven’t recognized him in this. But I have. If I, in false modesty, said I didn’t know what was going on, I would be as much of a liar as you are. But I do know, and I am doing what he says. Abraham—your ‘father’—with jubilant faith looked down the corridors of history and saw my day coming. He saw it and cheered.”",
			"57": "<sup class=\"versenum\">57 </sup>The Jews said, “You’re not even fifty years old—and Abraham saw you?”",
			"58": "<sup class=\"versenum\">58 </sup>“Believe me,” said Jesus, “<i>I am who I am</i> long before Abraham was anything.”",

But if I am doing them, put aside for a moment what you hear me say about myself and just take the evidence of the actions that are right before your eyes.

They took Jesus’ body and, following the Jewish burial custom, wrapped it in linen with the spices. There was a garden near the place he was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been placed. So, because it was Sabbath preparation for the Jews and the tomb was convenient, they placed Jesus in it."

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">20 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Early in the morning on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone was moved away from the entrance. She ran at once to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, breathlessly panting, “They took the Master from the tomb. We don’t know where they’ve put him.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-10 </sup>Peter and the other disciple left immediately for the tomb. They ran, neck and neck. The other disciple got to the tomb first, outrunning Peter. Stooping to look in, he saw the pieces of linen cloth lying there, but he didn’t go in. Simon Peter arrived after him, entered the tomb, observed the linen cloths lying there, and the kerchief used to cover his head not lying with the linen cloths but separate, neatly folded by itself. Then the other disciple, the one who had gotten there first, went into the tomb, took one look at the evidence, and believed. No one yet knew from the Scripture that he had to rise from the dead. The disciples then went back home.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-13 </sup>But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she knelt to look into the tomb and saw two angels sitting there, dressed in white, one at the head, the other at the foot of where Jesus’ body had been laid. They said to her, “Woman, why do you weep?”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>“They took my Master,” she said, “and I don’t know where they put him.” After she said this, she turned away and saw Jesus standing there. But she didn’t recognize him.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Jesus spoke to her, “Woman, why do you weep? Who are you looking for?”She, thinking that he was the gardener, said, “Mister, if you took him, tell me where you put him so I can care for him.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Jesus said, “Mary.”Turning to face him, she said in Hebrew, “<i>Rabboni!</i>” meaning “Teacher!”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Jesus said, “Don’t cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I ascend to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.’”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Mary Magdalene went, telling the news to the disciples: “I saw the Master!” And she told them everything he said to her.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-20 </sup>Later on that day, the disciples had gathered together, but, fearful of the Jews, had locked all the doors in the house. Jesus entered, stood among them, and said, “Peace to you.” Then he showed them his hands and side.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>The disciples, seeing the Master with their own eyes, were exuberant. Jesus repeated his greeting: “Peace to you. Just as the Father sent me, I send you.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>Then he took a deep breath and breathed into them. “Receive the Holy Spirit,” he said. “If you forgive someone’s sins, they’re gone for good. If you don’t forgive sins, what are you going to do with them?”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>But Thomas, sometimes called the Twin, one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples told him, “We saw the Master.”But he said, “Unless I see the nail holes in his hands, put my finger in the nail holes, and stick my hand in his side, I won’t believe it.”",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Eight days later, his disciples were again in the room. This time Thomas was with them. Jesus came through the locked doors, stood among them, and said, “Peace to you.”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then he focused his attention on Thomas. “Take your finger and examine my hands. Take your hand and stick it in my side. Don’t be unbelieving. Believe.”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Thomas said, “My Master! My God!”",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Jesus said, “So, you believe because you’ve seen with your own eyes. Even better blessings are in store for those who believe without seeing.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30-31 </sup>Jesus provided far more God-revealing signs than are written down in this book. These are written down so you will believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and in the act of believing, have real and eternal life in the way he personally revealed it."

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">21 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>After this, Jesus appeared again to the disciples, this time at the Tiberias Sea (the Sea of Galilee). This is how he did it: Simon Peter, Thomas (nicknamed “Twin”), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the brothers Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. Simon Peter announced, “I’m going fishing.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup>The rest of them replied, “We’re going with you.” They went out and got in the boat. They caught nothing that night. When the sun came up, Jesus was standing on the beach, but they didn’t recognize him.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Jesus spoke to them: “Good morning! Did you catch anything for breakfast?”They answered, “No.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>He said, “Throw the net off the right side of the boat and see what happens.”They did what he said. All of a sudden there were so many fish in it, they weren’t strong enough to pull it in.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-9 </sup>Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Master!”When Simon Peter realized that it was the Master, he threw on some clothes, for he was stripped for work, and dove into the sea. The other disciples came in by boat for they weren’t far from land, a hundred yards or so, pulling along the net full of fish. When they got out of the boat, they saw a fire laid, with fish and bread cooking on it.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-11 </sup>Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish you’ve just caught.” Simon Peter joined them and pulled the net to shore—153 big fish! And even with all those fish, the net didn’t rip.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Jesus said, “Breakfast is ready.” Not one of the disciples dared ask, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Master.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>Jesus then took the bread and gave it to them. He did the same with the fish. This was now the third time Jesus had shown himself alive to the disciples since being raised from the dead.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>After breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”“Yes, Master, you know I love you.”Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>He then asked a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”“Yes, Master, you know I love you.”Jesus said, “Shepherd my sheep.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-19 </sup>Then he said it a third time: “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”Peter was upset that he asked for the third time, “Do you love me?” so he answered, “Master, you know everything there is to know. You’ve got to know that I love you.”Jesus said, “Feed my sheep. I’m telling you the very truth now: When you were young you dressed yourself and went wherever you wished, but when you get old you’ll have to stretch out your hands while someone else dresses you and takes you where you don’t want to go.” He said this to hint at the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. And then he commanded, “Follow me.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>Turning his head, Peter noticed the disciple Jesus loved following right behind. When Peter noticed him, he asked Jesus, “Master, what’s going to happen to <i>him</i>?”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>Jesus said, “If I want him to live until I come again, what’s that to you? You—follow me.” That is how the rumor got out among the brothers that this disciple wouldn’t die. But that is not what Jesus said. He simply said, “If I want him to live until I come again, what’s that to you?”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>This is the same disciple who was eyewitness to all these things and wrote them down. And we all know that his eyewitness account is reliable and accurate.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>There are so many other things Jesus did. If they were all written down, each of them, one by one, I can’t imagine a world big enough to hold such a library of books."
