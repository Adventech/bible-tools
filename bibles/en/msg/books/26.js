			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>When I was thirty years of age, I was living with the exiles on the Kebar River. On the fifth day of the fourth month, the sky opened up and I saw visions of God.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>(It was the fifth day of the month in the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Word came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, on the banks of the Kebar River in the country of Babylon. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s hand came upon him that day.)",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-9 </sup>I looked: I saw an immense dust storm come from the north, an immense cloud with lightning flashing from it, a huge ball of fire glowing like bronze. Within the fire were what looked like four creatures vibrant with life. Each had the form of a human being, but each also had four faces and four wings. Their legs were as sturdy and straight as columns, but their feet were hoofed like those of a calf and sparkled from the fire like burnished bronze. On all four sides under their wings they had human hands. All four had both faces and wings, with the wings touching one another. They turned neither one way nor the other; they went straight forward.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-12 </sup>Their faces looked like this: In front a human face, on the right side the face of a lion, on the left the face of an ox, and in back the face of an eagle. So much for the faces. The wings were spread out with the tips of one pair touching the creature on either side; the other pair of wings covered its body. Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit went, they went. They didn’t turn as they went.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>The four creatures looked like a blazing fire, or like fiery torches. Tongues of fire shot back and forth between the creatures, and out of the fire, bolts of lightning. The creatures flashed back and forth like strikes of lightning.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>As I watched the four creatures, I saw something that looked like a wheel on the ground beside each of the four-faced creatures. This is what the wheels looked like: They were identical wheels, sparkling like diamonds in the sun. It looked like they were wheels within wheels, like a gyroscope.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-21 </sup>They went in any one of the four directions they faced, but straight, not veering off. The rims were immense, circled with eyes. When the living creatures went, the wheels went; when the living creatures lifted off, the wheels lifted off. Wherever the spirit went, they went, the wheels sticking right with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. When the creatures went, the wheels went; when the creatures stopped, the wheels stopped; when the creatures lifted off, the wheels lifted off, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-24 </sup>Over the heads of the living creatures was something like a dome, shimmering like a sky full of cut glass, vaulted over their heads. Under the dome one set of wings was extended toward the others, with another set of wings covering their bodies. When they moved I heard their wings—it was like the roar of a great waterfall, like the voice of The Strong God, like the noise of a battlefield. When they stopped, they folded their wings.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-28 </sup>And then, as they stood with folded wings, there was a voice from above the dome over their heads. Above the dome there was something that looked like a throne, sky-blue like a sapphire, with a humanlike figure towering above the throne. From what I could see, from the waist up he looked like burnished bronze and from the waist down like a blazing fire. Brightness everywhere! The way a rainbow springs out of the sky on a rainy day—that’s what it was like. It turned out to be the Glory of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>!When I saw all this, I fell to my knees, my face to the ground. Then I heard a voice."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>It said, “Son of man, stand up. I have something to say to you.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The moment I heard the voice, the Spirit entered me and put me on my feet. As he spoke to me, I listened.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-7 </sup>He said, “Son of man, I’m sending you to the family of Israel, a rebellious nation if there ever was one. They and their ancestors have fomented rebellion right up to the present. They’re a hard case, these people to whom I’m sending you—hardened in their sin. Tell them, ‘This is the Message of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master.’ They are a defiant bunch. Whether or not they listen, at least they’ll know that a prophet’s been here. But don’t be afraid of them, son of man, and don’t be afraid of anything they say. Don’t be afraid when living among them is like stepping on thorns or finding scorpions in your bed. Don’t be afraid of their mean words or their hard looks. They’re a bunch of rebels. Your job is to speak to them. Whether they listen is not your concern. They’re hardened rebels.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“Only take care, son of man, that you don’t rebel like these rebels. Open your mouth and eat what I give you.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>When I looked he had his hand stretched out to me, and in the hand a book, a scroll. He unrolled the scroll. On both sides, front and back, were written lamentations and mourning and doom."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>He told me, “Son of man, eat what you see. Eat this book. Then go and speak to the family of Israel.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>As I opened my mouth, he gave me the scroll to eat, saying, “Son of man, eat this book that I am giving you. Make a full meal of it!”So I ate it. It tasted so good—just like honey.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-6 </sup>Then he told me, “Son of man, go to the family of Israel and speak my Message. Look, I’m not sending you to a people who speak a hard-to-learn language with words you can hardly pronounce. If I had sent you to such people, their ears would have perked up and they would have listened immediately.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-9 </sup>“But it won’t work that way with the family of Israel. They won’t listen to you because they won’t listen to me. They are, as I said, a hard case, hardened in their sin. But I’ll make you as hard in your way as they are in theirs. I’ll make your face as hard as rock, harder than granite. Don’t let them intimidate you. Don’t be afraid of them, even though they’re a bunch of rebels.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-11 </sup>Then he said, “Son of man, get all these words that I’m giving you inside you. Listen to them obediently. Make them your own. And now go. Go to the exiles, your people, and speak. Tell them, ‘This is the Message of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master.’ Speak your piece, whether they listen or not.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>Then the Spirit picked me up. Behind me I heard a great commotion—“Blessed be the Glory of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> in his Sanctuary!”—the wings of the living creatures beating against each other, the whirling wheels, the rumble of a great earthquake.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>The Spirit lifted me and took me away. I went bitterly and angrily. I didn’t want to go. But <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had me in his grip. I arrived among the exiles who lived near the Kebar River at Tel Aviv. I came to where they were living and sat there for seven days, appalled.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>At the end of the seven days, I received this Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>:",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-19 </sup>“Son of man, I’ve made you a watchman for the family of Israel. Whenever you hear me say something, warn them for me. If I say to the wicked, ‘You are going to die,’ and you don’t sound the alarm warning them that it’s a matter of life or death, they will die and it will be your fault. I’ll hold you responsible. But if you warn the wicked and they keep right on sinning anyway, they’ll most certainly die for their sin, but <i>you</i> won’t die. You’ll have saved your life.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>“And if the righteous turn back from living righteously and take up with evil when I step in and put them in a hard place, they’ll die. If you haven’t warned them, they’ll die because of their sins, and none of the right things they’ve done will count for anything—and I’ll hold you responsible. But if you warn these righteous people not to sin and they listen to you, they’ll live because they took the warning—and again, you’ll have saved your life.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> grabbed me by the shoulder and said, “Get up. Go out on the plain. I want to talk with you.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>So I got up and went out on the plain. I couldn’t believe my eyes: the Glory of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>! Right there! It was like the Glory I had seen at the Kebar River. I fell to the ground, prostrate.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-26 </sup>Then the Spirit entered me and put me on my feet. He said, “Go home and shut the door behind you.” And then something odd: “Son of man: They’ll tie you hand and foot with ropes so you can’t leave the house. I’ll make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so you won’t be able to talk and tell the people what they’re doing wrong, even though they are a bunch of rebels.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>“But then when the time is ripe, I’ll free your tongue and you’ll say, ‘This is what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master, says: . . .’ From then on it’s up to them. They can listen or not listen, whichever they like. They <i>are</i> a bunch of rebels!”"
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>“Now, son of man, take a brick and place it before you. Draw a picture of the city Jerusalem on it. Then make a model of a military siege against the brick: Build siege walls, construct a ramp, set up army camps, lay in battering rams around it. Then get an iron skillet and place it upright between you and the city—an iron wall. Face the model: The city shall be under siege and you shall be the besieger. This is a sign to the family of Israel.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-5 </sup>“Next lie on your left side and place the sin of the family of Israel on yourself. You will bear their sin for as many days as you lie on your side. The number of days you bear their sin will match the number of years of their sin, namely, 390. For 390 days you will bear the sin of the family of Israel.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>“Then, after you have done this, turn over and lie down on your right side and bear the sin of the family of Judah. Your assignment this time is to lie there for forty days, a day for each year of their sin. Look straight at the siege of Jerusalem. Roll up your sleeve, shake your bare arm, and preach against her.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“I will tie you up with ropes, tie you so you can’t move or turn over until you have finished the days of the siege.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-12 </sup>“Next I want you to take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, dried millet and spelt, and mix them in a bowl to make a flat bread. This is your food ration for the 390 days you lie on your side. Measure out about half a pound for each day and eat it on schedule. Also measure out your daily ration of about a pint of water and drink it on schedule. Eat the bread as you would a muffin. Bake the muffins out in the open where everyone can see you, using dried human dung for fuel.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said, “This is what the people of Israel are going to do: Among the pagan nations where I will drive them, they will eat foods that are strictly taboo to a holy people.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>I said, “<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, my Master! Never! I’ve never contaminated myself with food like that. Since my youth I’ve never eaten anything forbidden by law, nothing found dead or violated by wild animals. I’ve never taken a single bite of forbidden food.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“All right,” he said. “I’ll let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human dung.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-17 </sup>Then he said to me, “Son of man, I’m going to cut off all food from Jerusalem. The people will live on starvation rations, worrying where the next meal’s coming from, scrounging for the next drink of water. Famine conditions. People will look at one another, see nothing but skin and bones, and shake their heads. This is what sin does.”"
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>“Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a straight razor, shaving your head and your beard. Then, using a set of balancing scales, divide the hair into thirds. When the days of the siege are over, take one-third of the hair and burn it inside the city. Take another third, chop it into bits with the sword and sprinkle it around the city. The final third you’ll throw to the wind. Then I’ll go after them with a sword.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup>“Retrieve a few of the hairs and slip them into your pocket. Take some of them and throw them into the fire—burn them up. From them, fire will spread to the whole family of Israel.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>“This is what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master, says: This means <i>Jerusalem.</i> I set her at the center of the world, all the nations ranged around her. But she rebelled against my laws and ordinances, rebelled far worse than the nations ranged around her—sheer wickedness!—refused my guidance, ignored my directions.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>“Therefore this is what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master, says: You’ve been more headstrong and willful than any of the nations around you, refusing my guidance, ignoring my directions. You’ve sunk to the gutter level of those around you.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-10 </sup>“Therefore this is what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master, says: I’m setting myself against you—yes, against you, Jerusalem. I’m going to punish you in full sight of the nations. Because of your disgusting no-god idols, I’m going to do something to you that I’ve never done before and will never do again: turn families into cannibals—parents eating children, children eating parents! Punishment indeed. And whoever’s left over I’ll throw to the winds.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>“Therefore, as sure as I am the living God—Decree of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master—because you’ve polluted my Sanctuary with your obscenities and disgusting no-god idols, I’m pulling out. Not an ounce of pity will I show you. A third of your people will die of either disease or hunger inside the city, a third will be killed outside the city, and a third will be thrown to the winds and chased by killers.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>“Only then will I calm down and let my anger cool. Then you’ll know that I was serious about this all along, that I’m a jealous God and not to be trifled with.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>“When I get done with you, you’ll be a pile of rubble. Nations who walk by will make coarse jokes. When I finish my angry punishment and searing rebukes, you’ll be reduced to an object of ridicule and mockery, turned into a horror story circulating among the surrounding nations. I, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, have spoken.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-17 </sup>“When I shoot my lethal famine arrows at you, I’ll shoot to kill. Then I’ll step up the famine and cut off food supplies. Famine and more famine—and then I’ll send in the wild animals to finish off your children. Epidemic disease, unrestrained murder, death—and I will have sent it! I, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, have spoken.”"
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-7 </sup>Then the Word of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> came to me: “Son of man, now turn and face the mountains of Israel and preach against them: ‘O Mountains of Israel, listen to the Message of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master, speaks to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and the valleys: I’m about to destroy your sacred god and goddess shrines. I’ll level your altars, bust up your sun-god pillars, and kill your people as they bow down to your no-god idols. I’ll stack the dead bodies of Israelites in front of your idols and then scatter your bones around your shrines. Every place where you’ve lived, the towns will be torn down and the pagan shrines demolished—altars busted up, idols smashed, all your custom-made sun-god pillars in ruins. Corpses everywhere you look! Then you’ll know that I am <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.",

In the foreign countries where they’re taken as prisoners of war, they’ll remember me. They’ll realize how devastated I was by their betrayals, by their voracious lust for gratifying themselves in their idolatries. They’ll be disgusted with their evil ways, disgusting to God in the way they’ve lived. They’ll know that I am <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. They’ll know that my judgment against them was no empty threat.",

They’re going to be killed, dying of hunger, dying of disease—death everywhere you look, people dropping like flies, people far away dying, people nearby dying, and whoever’s left in the city starving to death. Why? Because I’m angry, furiously angry. They’ll realize that I am <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> when they see their people’s corpses strewn over and around all their ruined sex-and-religion shrines on the bare hills and in the lush fertility groves, in all the places where they indulged their sensual rites. I’ll bring my hand down hard on them, demolish the country wherever they live, turn it into wasteland from one end to the other, from the wilderness to Riblah.

		"8": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">8 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-4 </sup>In the sixth year, in the sixth month and the fifth day, while I was sitting at home meeting with the leaders of Judah, it happened that the hand of my Master, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, gripped me. When I looked, I was astonished. What I saw looked like a man—from the waist down like fire and from the waist up like highly burnished bronze. He reached out what looked like a hand and grabbed me by the hair. The Spirit swept me high in the air and carried me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the Temple’s inside court where the image of the sex goddess that makes God so angry had been set up. Right before me was the Glory of the God of Israel, exactly like the vision I had seen out on the plain.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>He said to me, “Son of man, look north.” I looked north and saw it: Just north of the entrance loomed the altar of the sex goddess, Asherah, that makes God so angry.",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>He brought me to the door of the Temple court. I looked and saw a gaping hole in the wall.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>He said, “Son of man, dig through the wall.”I dug through the wall and came upon a door.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>He said, “Now walk through the door and take a look at the obscenities they’re engaging in.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-11 </sup>I entered and looked. I couldn’t believe my eyes: Painted all over the walls were pictures of reptiles and animals and monsters—the whole pantheon of Egyptian gods and goddesses—being worshiped by Israel. In the middle of the room were seventy of the leaders of Israel, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing in the middle. Each held his censer with the incense rising in a fragrant cloud.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>He said, “Son of man, do you see what the elders are doing here in the dark, each one before his favorite god-picture? They tell themselves, ‘<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> doesn’t see us. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has forsaken the country.’”",

			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Finally, he took me to the inside court of the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.

They fill the country with violence and now provoke me even further with their obscene gestures. That’s it. They have an angry God on their hands! From now on, no mercy. They can shout all they want, but I’m not listening.”"

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Six men came down the road from the upper gate that faces north, each carrying his lethal weapon. With them was a man dressed in linen with a writing case slung from his shoulder. They entered and stood by the bronze altar.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup>The Glory of the God of Israel ascended from his usual place above the cherubim-angels, moved to the threshold of the Temple, and called to the man with the writing case who was dressed in linen: “Go through the streets of Jerusalem and put a mark on the forehead of everyone who is in anguish over the outrageous obscenities being done in the city.”",

The upper rooms themselves were narrower, their galleries being wider than on the first and second floors of the building. The rooms on the third floor had no pillars like the pillars in the outside courtyard and were smaller than the rooms on the first and second floors. There was an outside wall parallel to the rooms and the outside courtyard. It fronted the rooms for eighty-seven and a half feet.
