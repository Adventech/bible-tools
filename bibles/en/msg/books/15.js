He wrote it out as follows:From Cyrus king of Persia, a Proclamation: <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the God of the heavens, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has also assigned me to build him a Temple of worship in Jerusalem, Judah. Who among you belongs to his people? God be with you! Go to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the God of Israel, Jerusalem’s God. Those who stay behind, wherever they happen to live, will support them with silver, gold, tools, and pack animals, along with Freewill-Offerings for The Temple of God in Jerusalem.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>The heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites—everyone, in fact, God prodded—set out to build The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> in Jerusalem. Their neighbors rallied behind them enthusiastically with silver, gold, tools, pack animals, expensive gifts, and, over and above these, Freewill-Offerings.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-10 </sup>Also, King Cyrus turned over to them all the vessels and utensils from The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> that Nebuchadnezzar had hauled from Jerusalem and put in the temple of his gods. Cyrus king of Persia put Mithredath the treasurer in charge of the transfer; he provided a full inventory for Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah, including the following:30 gold dishes1,000 silver dishes29 silver pans30 gold bowls410 duplicate silver bowls1,000 miscellaneous items.",

They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his hometown. They came in company with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.The numbers of the returning Israelites by families of origin were as follows:Parosh, 2,172Shephatiah, 372Arah, 775Pahath-Moab (sons of Jeshua and Joab), 2,812Elam, 1,254Zattu, 945Zaccai, 760Bani, 642Bebai, 623Azgad, 1,222Adonikam, 666Bigvai, 2,056Adin, 454Ater (sons of Hezekiah), 98Bezai, 323Jorah, 112Hashum, 223Gibbar, 95.Israelites identified by place of origin were as follows:Bethlehem, 123Netophah, 56Anathoth, 128Azmaveth, 42Kiriath Jearim, Kephirah, and Beeroth, 743Ramah and Geba, 621Micmash, 122Bethel and Ai, 223Nebo, 52Magbish, 156Elam (the other one), 1,254Harim, 320Lod, Hadid, and Ono, 725Jericho, 345Senaah, 3,630.Priestly families:Jedaiah (sons of Jeshua), 973Immer, 1,052Pashhur, 1,247Harim, 1,017.Levitical families:Jeshua and Kadmiel (sons of Hodaviah), 74.Singers:Asaph’s family line, 128.Security guard families:Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai, 139.Families of temple support staff:Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth,Keros, Siaha, Padon,Lebanah, Hagabah, Akkub,Hagab, Shalmai, Hanan,Giddel, Gahar, Reaiah,Rezin, Nekoda, Gazzam,Uzza, Paseah, Besai,Asnah, Meunim, Nephussim,Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur,Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha,Barkos, Sisera, Temah,Neziah, and Hatipha.Families of Solomon’s servants:Sotai, Hassophereth, Peruda,Jaala, Darkon, Giddel,Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-Hazzebaim, and Ami.Temple support staff and Solomon’s servants added up to 392.",

			"62": "<sup class=\"versenum\">62-63 </sup>They had thoroughly searched for their family records but couldn’t find them. And so they were barred from priestly work as ritually unclean. The governor ruled that they could not eat from the holy food until a priest could determine their status with the Urim and Thummim.",
			"64": "<sup class=\"versenum\">64-67 </sup>The total count for the congregation was 42,360. That did not include the male and female slaves, which numbered 7,337. There were also 200 male and female singers, and they had 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.",
			"68": "<sup class=\"versenum\">68-69 </sup>Some of the heads of families, on arriving at The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> in Jerusalem, made Freewill-Offerings toward the rebuilding of The Temple of God on its site. They gave to the building fund as they were able, about 1,100 pounds of gold, about three tons of silver, and 100 priestly robes.",
			"70": "<sup class=\"versenum\">70 </sup>The priests, Levites, and some of the people lived in Jerusalem. The singers, security guards, and temple support staff found places in their hometowns. All the Israelites found a place to live."

		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled into their towns, the people assembled together in Jerusalem. Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brother priests, along with Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and his relatives, went to work and built the Altar of the God of Israel to offer Whole-Burnt-Offerings on it as written in The Revelation of Moses the man of God.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-5 </sup>Even though they were afraid of what their non-Israelite neighbors might do, they went ahead anyway and set up the Altar on its foundations and offered Whole-Burnt-Offerings on it morning and evening. They also celebrated the Festival of Booths as prescribed and the daily Whole-Burnt-Offerings set for each day. And they presented the regular Whole-Burnt-Offerings for Sabbaths, New Moons, and <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Holy Festivals, as well as Freewill-Offerings for <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>They began offering Whole-Burnt-Offerings to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> from the very first day of the seventh month, even though The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s foundation had not yet been laid.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>They gave money to hire masons and carpenters. They gave food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians in exchange for the cedar lumber they had brought by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, a shipment authorized by Cyrus the king of Persia.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>In the second month of the second year after their arrival at The Temple of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jozadak, in company with their brother priests and Levites and everyone else who had come back to Jerusalem from captivity, got started. They appointed the Levites twenty years of age and older to direct the rebuilding of The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Jeshua and his family joined Kadmiel, Binnui, and Hodaviah, along with the extended family of Henadad—all Levites—to direct the work crew on The Temple of God.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-11 </sup>When the workers laid the foundation of The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the priests in their robes stood up with trumpets, and the Levites, sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> in the tradition of David king of Israel. They sang antiphonally praise and thanksgiving to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>:Yes! <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is good!Oh yes—he’ll never quit loving Israel!",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-13 </sup>All the people boomed out hurrahs, praising <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> as the foundation of The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> was laid. As many were noisily shouting with joy, many of the older priests, Levites, and family heads who had seen the first Temple, when they saw the foundations of this Temple laid, wept loudly for joy. People couldn’t distinguish the shouting from the weeping. The sound of their voices reverberated for miles around."

		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Old enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building The Temple of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> of Israel. They came to Zerubbabel and the family heads and said, “We’ll help you build. We worship your God the same as you. We’ve been offering sacrifices to him since Esarhaddon king of Assyria brought us here.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the family heads of Israel said to them, “Nothing doing. Building The Temple of our God is not the same thing to you as to us. We alone will build for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> of Israel. We’re the ones King Cyrus of Persia commanded to do it.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-5 </sup>So these people started beating down the morale of the people of Judah, harassing them as they built. They even hired propagandists to sap their resolve. They kept this up for about fifteen years, throughout the lifetime of Cyrus king of Persia and on into the reign of Darius king of Persia.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>In fact, in the reign of Xerxes, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against those living in Judah and Jerusalem.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Again later, in the time of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their associates wrote regarding the Jerusalem business to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated. (What follows is written in Aramaic.)",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-16 </sup>Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:From: Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, backed by the rest of their associates, the judges and officials over the people from Tripolis, Persia, Erech, and Babylon, Elamites of Susa, and all the others whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and other places in the land across the Euphrates.(This is the copy of the letter they sent to him.)To: King Artaxerxes from your servants from the land across the Euphrates.We are here to inform the king that the Jews who came from you to us have arrived in Jerusalem and have set about rebuilding that rebellious and evil city. They are busy at work finishing the walls and rebuilding the foundations. The king needs to know that once that city is rebuilt and the wall completed they will no longer pay a penny of tribute, tax, or duty. The royal treasury will feel the loss. We’re loyal to the king and cannot sit idly by while our king is being insulted—that’s why we are passing this information on. We suggest that you look into the court records of your ancestors; you’ll learn from those books that that city is a rebellious city, a thorn in the side to kings and provinces, a historic center of unrest and revolt. That’s why the city was wiped out. We are letting the king know that if that city gets rebuilt and its walls restored, you’ll end up with nothing in your province beyond the Euphrates.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-22 </sup>The king sent his reply to Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary, and the rest of their associates who lived in Samaria and other places beyond the Euphrates.Peace be with you. The letter that you sent has been translated and read to me. I gave orders to search the records, and sure enough it turns out that this city has revolted against kings time and again—rebellion is an old story there. I find that they’ve had their share of strong kings who have taken over beyond the Euphrates and exacted taxes, tribute, and duty. So do this: Order these men to stop work immediately—not a lick of rebuilding in that city unless I order it. Act quickly and firmly; they’ve done enough damage to kings!",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>The letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates. They lost no time. They went to the Jews in Jerusalem and made them quit work.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>That put a stop to the work on The Temple of God in Jerusalem. Nothing more was done until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Meanwhile the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo were preaching to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the authority of the God of Israel who ruled them. And so Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak started again, rebuilding The Temple of God in Jerusalem. The prophets of God were right there helping them.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup>Tattenai was governor of the land beyond the Euphrates at this time. Tattenai, Shethar-Bozenai, and their associates came to the Israelites and asked, “Who issued you a permit to rebuild this Temple and restore it to use?” Then we told them the names of the men responsible for this construction work.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>But God had his eye on the leaders of the Jews, and the work wasn’t stopped until a report could reach Darius and an official reply be returned.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>Tattenai, governor of the land beyond the Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and his associates—the officials of that land—sent a letter to Darius the king. This is what they wrote to him:To Darius the king. Peace and blessing!",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>We want to report to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to The Temple of the great God that is being rebuilt with large stones. Timbers are being fitted into the walls; the work is going on with great energy and in good time.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>We asked the leaders, “Who issued you the permit to rebuild this Temple and restore it to use?” We also asked for their names so we could pass them on to you and have a record of the men at the head of the construction work.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>This is what they told us: “We are servants of the God of the heavens and the earth. We are rebuilding The Temple that was built a long time ago. A great king of Israel built it, the entire structure. But our ancestors made the God of the heavens really angry and he turned them over to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who knocked this Temple down and took the people to Babylon in exile.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-16 </sup>“But when Cyrus became king of Babylon, in his first year he issued a building permit to rebuild this Temple of God. He also gave back the gold and silver vessels of The Temple of God that Nebuchadnezzar had carted off and put in the Babylon temple. Cyrus the king removed them from the temple of Babylon and turned them over to Sheshbazzar, the man he had appointed governor. He told him, ‘Take these vessels and place them in The Temple of Jerusalem and rebuild The Temple of God on its original site.’ And Sheshbazzar did it. He laid the foundation of The Temple of God in Jerusalem. It has been under construction ever since but it is not yet finished.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>So now, if it please the king, look up the records in the royal archives in Babylon and see if it is indeed a fact that Cyrus the king issued an official building permit authorizing the rebuilding of The Temple of God in Jerusalem. And then send the king’s ruling on this matter to us."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>So King Darius ordered a search through the records in the archives in Babylon. Eventually a scroll was turned up in the fortress of Ecbatana over in the province of Media, with this writing on it:MemorandumIn his first year as king, Cyrus issued an official decree regarding The Temple of God in Jerusalem, as follows:",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-5 </sup>The Temple where sacrifices are offered is to be rebuilt on new foundations. It is to be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide with three courses of large stones topped with one course of timber. The cost is to be paid from the royal bank. The gold and silver vessels from The Temple of God that Nebuchadnezzar carried to Babylon are to be returned to The Temple at Jerusalem, each to its proper place; place them in The Temple of God.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>Now listen, Tattenai governor of the land beyond the Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, associates, and all officials of that land: Stay out of their way. Leave the governor and leaders of the Jews alone so they can work on that Temple of God as they rebuild it.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-10 </sup>I hereby give official orders on how you are to help the leaders of the Jews in the rebuilding of that Temple of God:1. All construction costs are to be paid to these men from the royal bank out of the taxes coming in from the land beyond the Euphrates. And pay them on time, without delays.2. Whatever is required for their worship—young bulls, rams, and lambs for Whole-Burnt-Offerings to the God-of-Heaven; and whatever wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil the priests of Jerusalem request—is to be given to them daily without delay so that they may make sacrifices to the God-of-Heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>I’ve issued an official decree that anyone who violates this order is to be impaled on a timber torn out of his own house, and the house itself made a manure pit. And may the God who put his Name on that place wipe out any king or people who dares to defy this decree and destroy The Temple of God at Jerusalem.I, Darius, have issued an official decree. Carry it out precisely and promptly.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Tattenai governor of the land across the Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and their associates did it: They carried out the decree of Darius precisely and promptly.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>So the leaders of the Jews continued to build; the work went well under the preaching of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo. They completed the rebuilding under orders of the God of Israel and authorization by Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-18 </sup>And then the Israelites celebrated—priests, Levites, every last exile, exuberantly celebrated the dedication of The Temple of God. At the dedication of this Temple of God they sacrificed a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, and four hundred lambs—and, as an Absolution-Offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. They placed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their places for the service of God at Jerusalem—all as written out in the Book of Moses.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>All the priests and Levites had purified themselves—all, no exceptions. They were all ritually clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for the exiles, their brother priests, and themselves.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-22 </sup>Then the Israelites who had returned from exile, along with everyone who had removed themselves from the defilements of the nations to join them and seek <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the God of Israel, ate the Passover. With great joy they celebrated the Feast of Unraised Bread for seven days. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had plunged them into a sea of joy; he had changed the mind of the king of Assyria to back them in rebuilding The Temple of God, the God of Israel."
		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-5 </sup>After all this, Ezra. It was during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia. Ezra was the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the high priest.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>That’s Ezra. He arrived from Babylon, a scholar well-practiced in the Revelation of Moses that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> of Israel had given. Because <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s hand was on Ezra, the king gave him everything he asked for. Some of the Israelites—priests, Levites, singers, temple security guards, and temple slaves—went with him to Jerusalem. It was in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-10 </sup>They arrived at Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king’s reign. Ezra had scheduled their departure from Babylon on the first day of the first month; they arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month under the generous guidance of his God. Ezra had committed himself to studying the Revelation of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, to living it, and to teaching Israel to live its truths and ways.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>What follows is the letter that King Artaxerxes gave Ezra, priest and scholar, expert in matters involving the truths and ways of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> concerning Israel:",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-20 </sup>Artaxerxes, King of Kings, to Ezra the priest, a scholar of the Teaching of the God-of-Heaven.Peace. I hereby decree that any of the people of Israel living in my kingdom who want to go to Jerusalem, including their priests and Levites, may go with you. You are being sent by the king and his seven advisors to carry out an investigation of Judah and Jerusalem in relation to the Teaching of your God that you are carrying with you. You are also authorized to take the silver and gold that the king and his advisors are giving for the God of Israel, whose residence is in Jerusalem, along with all the silver and gold that has been collected from the generously donated offerings all over Babylon, including that from the people and the priests, for The Temple of their God in Jerusalem. Use this money carefully to buy bulls, rams, lambs, and the ingredients for Grain-Offerings and Drink-Offerings and then offer them on the Altar of The Temple of your God in Jerusalem. You are free to use whatever is left over from the silver and gold for what you and your brothers decide is in keeping with the will of your God. Deliver to the God of Jerusalem the vessels given to you for the services of worship in The Temple of your God. Whatever else you need for The Temple of your God you may pay for out of the royal bank.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-23 </sup>I, Artaxerxes the king, have formally authorized and ordered all the treasurers of the land across the Euphrates to give Ezra the priest, scholar of the Teaching of the God-of-Heaven, the full amount of whatever he asks for up to 100 talents of silver, 650 bushels of wheat, and 607 gallons each of wine and olive oil. There is no limit on the salt. Everything the God-of-Heaven requires for The Temple of God must be given without hesitation. Why would the king and his sons risk stirring up his wrath?",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Also, let it be clear that no one is permitted to impose tribute, tax, or duty on any priest, Levite, singer, temple security guard, temple servant, or any other worker connected with The Temple of God.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>I authorize you, Ezra, exercising the wisdom of God that you have in your hands, to appoint magistrates and judges so they can administer justice among all the people of the land across the Euphrates who live by the Teaching of your God. Anyone who does not know the Teaching, you teach them.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Anyone who does not obey the Teaching of your God and the king must be tried and sentenced at once—death, banishment, a fine, prison, whatever.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27-28 </sup>Blessed be <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the God-of-Our-Fathers, who put it in the mind of the king to beautify The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> in Jerusalem! Not only that, he caused the king and all his advisors and influential officials actually to like me and back me. My God was on my side and I was ready to go. And I organized all the leaders of Israel to go with me."

			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-17 </sup>I gathered them together at the canal that runs to Ahava. We camped there three days. I looked them over and found that they were all laymen and priests but no Levites. So I sent for the leaders Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, and for the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan. I then sent them to Iddo, who is head of the town of Casiphia, and told them what to say to Iddo and his relatives who lived there in Casiphia: “Send us ministers for The Temple of God.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-20 </sup>Well, the generous hand of our God was on us, and they brought back to us a wise man from the family of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel. His name was Sherebiah. With sons and brothers they numbered eighteen. They also brought Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the family of Merari, with brothers and their sons, another twenty. And then there were 220 temple servants, descendants of the temple servants that David and the princes had assigned to help the Levites in their work. They were all signed up by name.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-22 </sup>I proclaimed a fast there beside the Ahava Canal, a fast to humble ourselves before our God and pray for wise guidance for our journey—all our people and possessions. I was embarrassed to ask the king for a cavalry bodyguard to protect us from bandits on the road. We had just told the king, “Our God lovingly looks after all those who seek him, but turns away in disgust from those who leave him.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>So we fasted and prayed about these concerns. And he listened.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-27 </sup>Then I picked twelve of the leading priests—Sherebiah and Hashabiah with ten of their brothers.

On the fourth day the silver and gold and vessels were weighed out in The Temple of our God into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest.

Whatever you do, don’t give your daughters in marriage to their sons nor marry your sons to their daughters.

And it’s the rainy season; you can’t expect us to stand out here soaking wet until this is done—why, it will take days! A lot of us are deeply involved in this transgression. Let our leaders act on behalf of the whole congregation.
