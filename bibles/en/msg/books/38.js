So give to the people this Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies: ‘Come back to me and I’ll come back to you. Don’t be like your parents. The old-time prophets called out to them, “A Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies: Leave your evil life. Quit your evil practices.” But they ignored everything I said to them, stubbornly refused to listen.’",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>“And where are your ancestors now? Dead and buried. And the prophets who preached to them? Also dead and buried. But the Message that my servants the prophets spoke, that isn’t dead and buried. That Message did its work on your ancestors, did it not? It woke them up and they came back, saying, ‘He did what he said he would do, sure enough. We didn’t get by with a thing.’”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month in the second year of the reign of Darius, the Message of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> was given to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, son of Iddo:",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>One night I looked out and saw a man astride a red horse. He was in the shadows in a grove of birches. Behind him were more horses—a red, a chestnut, and a white.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>I said, “Sir, what are these horses doing here? What’s the meaning of this?”The Angel-Messenger said, “Let me show you.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then the rider in the birch grove spoke up, “These are the riders that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> sent to check things out on earth.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>They reported their findings to the Angel of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> in the birch grove: “We have looked over the whole earth and all is well. Everything’s under control.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The Angel of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> reported back, “O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies, how long are you going to stay angry with Jerusalem and the cities of Judah? When are you going to let up? Isn’t seventy years long enough?”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-15 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> reassured the Angel-Messenger—good words, comforting words—who then addressed me: “Tell them this. Tell them that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies has spoken. This is <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message: ‘I care deeply for Jerusalem and Zion. I feel very possessive of them. But I’m thoroughly angry with the godless nations that act as if they own the whole world. I was only moderately angry earlier, but now they’ve gone too far. I’m going into action.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-17 </sup>“‘I’ve come back to Jerusalem, but with compassion this time.’This is <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> speaking.‘I’ll see to it that my Temple is rebuilt.’A Decree of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies!‘The rebuilding operation is already staked out.’Say it again—a Decree of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies:‘My cities will prosper again,<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> will comfort Zion again,Jerusalem will be back in my favor again.’”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>I looked up, and was surprised by another vision: four horns!",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>I asked the Messenger-Angel, “And what’s the meaning of this?”He said, “These are the powers that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem abroad.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Then <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> expanded the vision to include four blacksmiths.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>I asked, “And what are these all about?”He said, “Since the ‘horns’ scattered Judah so badly that no one had any hope left, these blacksmiths have arrived to combat the horns. They’ll dehorn the godless nations who used their horns to scatter Judah to the four winds.”"

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span><sup class=\"versenum mid-line\">1-5 </sup>I looked up and was surprised to seea man holding a tape measure in his hand.I said, “What are you up to?”“I’m on my way,” he said, “to survey Jerusalem,to measure its width and length.”Just then the Messenger-Angel on his way outmet another angel coming in and said,“Run! Tell the Surveyor, ‘Jerusalem will burst its walls—bursting with people, bursting with animals.And I’ll be right there with her’—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Decree—‘a wall of firearound unwalled Jerusalem and a radiant presence within.’”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>“Up on your feet! Get out of there—and now!” <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> says so.“Return from your far exile.I scattered you to the four winds.” <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Decree.“Escape from Babylon, Zion, and come home—now!”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies, the One of Glory who sent me on my mission, commenting on the godless nations who stripped you and left you homeless, said, “Anyone who hits you, hits me—bloodies my nose, blackens my eye. Yes, and at the right time I’ll give the signal and they’ll be stripped and thrown out by their own servants.” Then you’ll know for sure that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies sent me on this mission.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“Shout and celebrate, Daughter of Zion!I’m on my way. I’m moving into your neighborhood!”<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Decree.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>Many godless nations will be linked up with <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> at that time. (“They will become my family! I’ll live in their homes!”) And then you’ll know for sure that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies sent me on this mission. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> will reclaim his Judah inheritance in the Holy Land. He’ll again make clear that Jerusalem is his choice.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Quiet, everyone! Shh! Silence before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Something’s afoot in his holy house. He’s on the move!"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Next the Messenger-Angel showed me the high priest Joshua. He was standing before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Angel where the Accuser showed up to accuse him. Then <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said to the Accuser, “I, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, rebuke you, Accuser! I rebuke you and choose Jerusalem. Surprise! Everything is going up in flames, but I reach in and pull out Jerusalem!”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup>Joshua, standing before the angel, was dressed in dirty clothes. The angel spoke to his attendants, “Get him out of those filthy clothes,” and then said to Joshua, “Look, I’ve stripped you of your sin and dressed you up in clean clothes.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>I spoke up and said, “How about a clean new turban for his head also?” And they did it—put a clean new turban on his head. Then they finished dressing him, with <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Angel looking on.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Angel then charged Joshua, “Orders from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies: ‘If you live the way I tell you and remain obedient in my service, then you’ll make the decisions around here and oversee my affairs. And all my attendants standing here will be at your service.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>“‘Careful, High Priest Joshua—both you and your friends sitting here with you, for your friends are in on this, too! Here’s what I’m doing next: I’m introducing my servant Branch. And note this: This stone that I’m placing before Joshua, a single stone with seven eyes’—Decree of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies—‘I’ll engrave with these words: “I’ll strip this land of its filthy sin, all at once, in a single day.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“‘At that time, everyone will get along with one another, with friendly visits across the fence, friendly visits on one another’s porches.’”"
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>The Messenger-Angel again called me to attention. It was like being wakened out of deep sleep.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>He said, “What do you see?”I answered, “I see a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top. Seven lamps, each with seven spouts, are set on the bowl. And there are two olive trees, one on either side of the bowl.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then I asked the Messenger-Angel, “What does this mean, sir?”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-7 </sup>The Messenger-Angel said, “Can’t you tell?”“No, sir,” I said.Then he said, “This is <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message to Zerubbabel: ‘You can’t force these things. They only come about through my Spirit,’ says <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies. ‘So, big mountain, who do you think you are? Next to Zerubbabel you’re nothing but a molehill. He’ll proceed to set the Cornerstone in place, accompanied by cheers: Yes! Yes! Do it!’”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-10 </sup>After that, the Word of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> came to me: “Zerubbabel started rebuilding this Temple and he will complete it. That will be your confirmation that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies sent me to you. Does anyone dare despise this day of small beginnings? They’ll change their tune when they see Zerubbabel setting the last stone in place!”Going back to the vision, the Messenger-Angel said, “The seven lamps are the eyes of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> probing the dark corners of the world like searchlights.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>And the two olive trees on either side of the lampstand?” I asked. “What’s the meaning of them? And while you’re at it, the two branches of the olive trees that feed oil to the lamps—what do they mean?”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>He said, “You haven’t figured that out?”I said, “No, sir.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>He said, “These are the two who stand beside the Master of the whole earth and supply golden lamp oil worldwide.”"
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>I looked up again and saw—surprise!—a book on the wing! A book flying!",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The Messenger-Angel said to me, “What do you see now?”I said, “I see a book flying, a huge book—thirty feet long and fifteen wide!”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup>He told me, “This book is the verdict going out worldwide against thieves and liars. The first half of the book disposes of everyone who steals; the second half takes care of everyone who lies. I launched it”—Decree of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies—“and so it will fly into the house of every thief and every liar. It will land in each house and tear it down, timbers and stones.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The Messenger-Angel appeared and said, “Look up. Tell me what you see.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>I said, “What in the world is that?”He said, “This is a bushel basket on a journey. It holds the sin of everyone, everywhere.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Then the lid made of lead was removed from the basket—and there was a woman sitting in it!",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>He said, “This is Miss Wicked.” He pushed her back down into the basket and clamped the lead lid over her.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then I looked up and to my surprise saw two women flying. On outstretched wings they airlifted the bushel basket into the sky.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>I said to the Messenger-Angel, “Where are they taking the bushel basket?”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>He said, “East to the land of Shinar. They will build a garage to house it. When it’s finished, the basket will be stored there.”"
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>Once again I looked up—another strange sight! Four chariots charging out from between two mountains. The mountains were bronze.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>The first chariot was drawn by red horses, the second chariot by black horses, the third chariot by white horses, and the fourth chariot by dappled horses. All the horses were powerful.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>I asked the Messenger-Angel, “Sir, what’s the meaning here?”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-7 </sup>The angel answered, “These are the four winds of heaven, which originate with the Master of the whole earth. The black horses are headed north with the white ones right after them. The dappled horses are headed south.” The powerful horses galloped out, bursting with energy, eager to patrol through the earth. The Messenger-Angel commanded: “On your way! Survey the earth!” and they were off in every direction.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Then he called to me and said, “Look at them go! The ones going north are conveying a sense of my Spirit, serene and secure. No more trouble from that direction.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-12 </sup>Then this Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> came to me: “Take up a collection from the exiles. Target Heldai, Tobiah, and Jedaiah. They’ve just arrived from Babylon. You’ll find them at the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah. Collect silver and gold from them and fashion crowns. Place one on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and give him this message:",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>“‘A Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies. Be alert. We have a man here whose name is Branch. He will branch out from where he is and build the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Yes, he’s the one. He’ll build the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Then he’ll assume the role of royalty, take his place on the throne and rule—a priest sitting on the throne!—showing that king and priest can coexist in harmony.’",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“The other crown will be in the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> as a symbol of royalty, under the custodial care of Helem, Tobiah, Jedaiah, and Hen son of Zephaniah.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“People will come from faraway places to pitch in and rebuild the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. This will confirm that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies did, in fact, send me to you. All this follows as you put your minds to a life of responsive obedience to the voice of your <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.”"
		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7 </span>On the fourth day of the ninth month, in the fourth year of the reign of King Darius, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message again came to Zechariah.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>The town of Bethel had sent a delegation headed by Sarezer and Regem-Melech to pray for <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s blessing and to confer with the priests of the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies, and also with the prophets. They posed this question: “Should we plan for a day of mourning and abstinence next August, the seventieth anniversary of Jerusalem’s fall, as we have been doing all these years?”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-6 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies gave me this Message for them, for all the people and for the priests: “When you held days of fasting every fifth and seventh month all these seventy years, were you doing it for me? And when you held feasts, was that for me? Hardly. You’re interested in religion, I’m interested in people.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-10 </sup>“There’s nothing new to say on the subject. Don’t you still have the message of the earlier prophets from the time when Jerusalem was still a thriving, bustling city and the outlying countryside, the Negev and Shephelah, was populated? [This is the message that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> gave Zechariah.] Well, the message hasn’t changed. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies said then and says now:“‘Treat one another justly.Love your neighbors.Be compassionate with each other.Don’t take advantage of widows, orphans, visitors, and the poor.Don’t plot and scheme against one another—that’s evil.’",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-13 </sup>“But did your ancestors listen? No, they set their jaws in defiance. They shut their ears. They steeled themselves against <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s revelation and the Spirit-filled sermons preached by the earlier prophets by order of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies. And <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> became angry, really angry, because he told them everything plainly and they wouldn’t listen to a word he said.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>“So [this is what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies said] if they won’t listen to me, I won’t listen to them. I scattered them to the four winds. They ended up strangers wherever they were. Their ‘promised land’ became a vacant lot—weeds and tin cans and thistles. Not a sign of life. They turned a dreamland into a wasteland.”"
		},
		"8": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">8 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>And then these Messages from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies:A Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies:“I am zealous for Zion—I <i>care!</i>I’m angry about Zion—I’m <i>involved!”</i><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message:",

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-5 </sup>A Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies:“Old men and old women will come back to Jerusalem, sit on benches on the streets and spin tales, move around safely with their canes—a good city to grow old in. And boys and girls will fill the public parks, laughing and playing—a good city to grow up in.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>A Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies:“Do the problems of returning and rebuilding by just a few survivors seem too much? But is anything too much for me? Not if I have my say.”",

I’ll bring them back and move them into Jerusalem. They’ll be my people and I’ll be their God. I’ll stick with them and do right by them.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>A Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies:“Get a grip on things. Hold tight, you who are listening to what I say through the preaching of the prophets. The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies has been reestablished. The Temple is being rebuilt. We’ve come through a hard time: You worked for a pittance and were lucky to get that; the streets were dangerous; you could never let down your guard; I had turned the world into an armed camp.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>“But things have changed. I’m taking the side of my core of surviving people:Sowing and harvesting will resume,Vines will grow grapes,Gardens will flourish,Dew and rain will make everything green.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>“My core survivors will get everything they need—and more. You’ve gotten a reputation as a bad-news people, you people of Judah and Israel, but I’m coming to save you. From now on, you’re the good-news people. Don’t be afraid. Keep a firm grip on what I’m doing.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-17 </sup>A Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies:“In the same way that I decided to punish you when your ancestors made me angry, and didn’t pull my punches, at this time I’ve decided to bless Jerusalem and the country of Judah. Don’t be afraid. And now here’s what I want you to do: Tell the truth, the whole truth, when you speak. Do the right thing by one another, both personally and in your courts. Don’t cook up plans to take unfair advantage of others. Don’t do or say what isn’t so. I hate all that stuff. Keep your lives simple and honest.” Decree of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.",
