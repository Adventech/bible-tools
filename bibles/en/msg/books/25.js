			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Jerusalem, who outsinned the whole world, is an outcast.All who admired her despise her now that they see beneath the surface.Miserable, she groans and turns away in shame.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>She played fast and loose with life, she never considered tomorrow,and now she’s crashed royally, with no one to hold her hand:“Look at my pain, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>! And how the enemy cruelly struts.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The enemy reached out to take all her favorite things. She watchedas pagans barged into her Sanctuary, those very people for whomyou posted orders: <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">keep out: this assembly off-limits.</span>",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>All the people groaned, so desperate for food, so desperate to stay alivethat they bartered their favorite things for a bit of breakfast:“O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, look at me! Worthless, cheap, abject!",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>“And you passersby, look at me! Have you ever seen anything like this?Ever seen pain like my pain, seen what he did to me,what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\"><i>God</i></span> did to me in his rage?",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>“He struck me with lightning, skewered me from head to foot,then he set traps all around so I could hardly move.He left me with nothing—left me sick, and sick of living.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“He wove my sins into a ropeand harnessed me to captivity’s yoke.I’m goaded by cruel taskmasters.",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>“I called to my friends; they betrayed me.My priests and my leaders only looked after themselves,trying but failing to save their own skins.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>“O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, look at the trouble I’m in! My stomach in knots,my heart wrecked by a life of rebellion.Massacres in the streets, starvation in the houses.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>“Oh, listen to my groans. No one listens, no one cares.When my enemies heard of the trouble you gave me, they cheered.Bring on Judgment Day! Let them get what I got!",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>“Take a good look at their evil ways and give it to them!Give them what you gave me for my sins.Groaning in pain, body and soul, I’ve had all I can take.”"

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Like an enemy, he aimed his bow, bared his sword,and killed our young men, our pride and joy.His anger, like fire, burned down the homes in Zion.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The Master became the enemy. He had Israel for supper.He chewed up and spit out all the defenses.He left Daughter Judah moaning and groaning.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>He plowed up his old trysting place, trashed his favorite rendezvous.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> wiped out Zion’s memories of feast days and Sabbaths,angrily sacked king and priest alike.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> abandoned his altar, walked away from his holy Templeand turned the fortifications over to the enemy.As they cheered in <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Temple, you’d have thought it was a feast day!",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> drew up plans to tear down the walls of Daughter Zion.He assembled his crew, set to work and went at it.Total demolition! The stones wept!",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Her city gates, iron bars and all, disappeared in the rubble:her kings and princes off to exile—no one left to instruct or lead;her prophets useless—they neither saw nor heard anything from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The elders of Daughter Zion sit silent on the ground.They throw dust on their heads, dress in rough penitential burlap—the young virgins of Jerusalem, their faces creased with the dirt.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>My eyes are blind with tears, my stomach in a knot.My insides have turned to jelly over my people’s fate.Babies and children are fainting all over the place,",

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>How can I understand your plight, dear Jerusalem?What can I say to give you comfort, dear Zion?Who can put you together again? This bust-up is past understanding.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Your prophets courted you with sweet talk.They didn’t face you with your sin so that you could repent.Their sermons were all wishful thinking, deceptive illusions.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Astonished, passersby can’t believe what they see.They rub their eyes, they shake their heads over Jerusalem.Is this the city voted “Most Beautiful” and “Best Place to Live”?",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But now your enemies gape, slack-jawed.Then they rub their hands in glee: “We’ve got them!We’ve been waiting for this! Here it is!”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> did carry out, item by item, exactly what he said he’d do.He always said he’d do this. Now he’s done it—torn the place down.He’s let your enemies walk all over you, declared them world champions!",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Give out heart-cries to the Master, dear repentant Zion.Let the tears roll like a river, day and night,and keep at it—no time-outs. Keep those tears flowing!",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>As each night watch begins, get up and cry out in prayer.Pour your heart out face-to-face with the Master.Lift high your hands. Beg for the lives of your childrenwho are starving to death out on the streets.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>“Look at us, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Think it over. Have you ever treated <i>anyone</i> like this?Should women eat their own babies, the very children they raised?Should priests and prophets be murdered in the Master’s own Sanctuary?",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>“Boys and old men lie in the gutters of the streets,my young men and women killed in their prime.Angry, you killed them in cold blood, cut them down without mercy.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>“You invited, like friends to a party, men to swoop down in attackso that on the big day of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s wrath no one would get away.The children I loved and reared—gone, gone, gone.”"

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-6 </sup>He turned me into a scarecrowof skin and bones, then broke the bones.He hemmed me in, ganged up on me,poured on the trouble and hard times.He locked me up in deep darkness,like a corpse nailed inside a coffin.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-9 </sup>He shuts me in so I’ll never get out,manacles my hands, shackles my feet.Even when I cry out and plead for help,he locks up my prayers and throws away the key.He sets up blockades with quarried limestone.He’s got me cornered.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-12 </sup>He’s a prowling bear tracking me down,a lion in hiding ready to pounce.He knocked me from the path and ripped me to pieces.When he finished, there was nothing left of me.He took out his bow and arrowsand used me for target practice.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-15 </sup>He shot me in the stomachwith arrows from his quiver.Everyone took me for a joke,made me the butt of their mocking ballads.He forced rotten, stinking food down my throat,bloated me with vile drinks.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-18 </sup>He ground my face into the gravel.He pounded me into the mud.I gave up on life altogether.I’ve forgotten what the good life is like.I said to myself, “This is it. I’m finished.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is a lost cause.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-21 </sup>I’ll never forget the trouble, the utter lostness,the taste of ashes, the poison I’ve swallowed.I remember it all—oh, how well I remember—the feeling of hitting the bottom.But there’s one other thing I remember,and remembering, I keep a grip on hope:",

			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-27 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> proves to be good to the man who passionately waits,to the woman who diligently seeks.It’s a good thing to quietly hope,quietly hope for help from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.It’s a good thing when you’re youngto stick it out through the hard times.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28-30 </sup>When life is heavy and hard to take,go off by yourself. Enter the silence.Bow in prayer. Don’t ask questions:Wait for hope to appear.Don’t run from trouble. Take it full-face.The “worst” is never the worst.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31-33 </sup>Why? Because the Master won’t everwalk out and fail to return.If he works severely, he also works tenderly.His stockpiles of loyal love are immense.He takes no pleasure in making life hard,in throwing roadblocks in the way:",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34-36 </sup>Stomping down hardon luckless prisoners,Refusing justice to victimsin the court of High God,Tampering with evidence—the Master does not approve of such things.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37-39 </sup>Who do you think “spoke and it happened”?It’s the Master who gives such orders.Doesn’t the High God speak everything,good things and hard things alike, into being?And why would anyone gifted with lifecomplain when punished for sin?",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40-42 </sup>Let’s take a good look at the way we’re livingand reorder our lives under <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.Let’s lift our hearts and hands at one and the same time,praying to God in heaven:“We’ve been contrary and willful,and you haven’t forgiven.",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43-45 </sup>“You lost your temper with us, holding nothing back.You chased us and cut us down without mercy.You wrapped yourself in thick blankets of cloudsso no prayers could get through.You treated us like dirty dishwater,threw us out in the backyard of the nations.",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46-48 </sup>“Our enemies shout abuse,their mouths full of derision, spitting invective.We’ve been to hell and back.We’ve nowhere to turn, nowhere to go.Rivers of tears pour from my eyesat the smashup of my dear people.",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49-51 </sup>“The tears stream from my eyes,an artesian well of tears,Until you, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, look down from on high,look and see my tears.When I see what’s happened to the young women in the city,the pain breaks my heart.",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52-54 </sup>“Enemies with no reason to be enemieshunted me down like a bird.They threw me into a pit,then pelted me with stones.Then the rains came and filled the pit.The water rose over my head. I said, ‘It’s all over.’",
			"55": "<sup class=\"versenum\">55-57 </sup>“I called out your name, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>,called from the bottom of the pit.You listened when I called out, ‘Don’t shut your ears!Get me out of here! Save me!’You came close when I called out.You said, ‘It’s going to be all right.’",

Hunt them down.Make a total demolition here under your heaven!”"

			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>The evil guilt of my dear peoplewas worse than the sin of Sodom—The city was destroyed in a flash,and no one around to help.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The splendid and sacred noblesonce glowed with health.Their bodies were robust and ruddy,their beards like carved stone.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But now they are smeared with soot,unrecognizable in the street,Their bones sticking out,their skin dried out like old leather.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Better to have been killed in battlethan killed by starvation.Better to have died of battle woundsthan to slowly starve to death.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Nice and kindly womenboiled their own children for supper.This was the only food in townwhen my dear people were broken.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> let all his anger loose, held nothing back.He poured out his raging wrath.He set a fire in Zionthat burned it to the ground.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The kings of the earth couldn’t believe it.World rulers were in shock,Watching old enemies march in big as you please,right through Jerusalem’s gates.",

Woe! Would that we’d never sinned!Because of all this we’re heartsick;we can’t see through the tears.On Mount Zion, wrecked and ruined,jackals pace and prowl.And yet, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, you’re sovereign still,your throne intact and eternal.So why do you keep forgetting us?Why dump us and leave us like this?Bring us back to you, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>—we’re ready to come back.Give us a fresh start.As it is, you’ve cruelly disowned us.You’ve been so very angry with us.”"
