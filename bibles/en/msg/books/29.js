			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message to Joel son of Pethuel:Attention, elder statesmen! Listen closely,everyone, whoever and wherever you are!Have you ever heard of anything like this?Has anything like this ever happened before—ever?Make sure you tell your children,and your children tell their children,And their children <i>their</i> children.Don’t let this message die out.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>What the chewing locust left,the gobbling locust ate;What the gobbling locust left,the munching locust ate;What the munching locust left,the chomping locust ate.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-7 </sup>Sober up, you drunks!Get in touch with reality—and weep!Your supply of booze is cut off.You’re on the wagon, like it or not.My country’s being invadedby an army invincible, past numbering,Teeth like those of a lion,fangs like those of a tiger.It has ruined my vineyards,stripped my orchards,And clear-cut the country.The landscape’s a moonscape.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-10 </sup>Weep like a young virgin dressed in black,mourning the loss of her fiancé.Without grain and grapes,worship has been brought to a standstillin the Sanctuary of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.The priests are at a loss.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s ministers don’t know what to do.The fields are sterile.The very ground grieves.The wheat fields are lifeless,vineyards dried up, olive oil gone.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>Dirt farmers, despair!Grape growers, wring your hands!Lament the loss of wheat and barley.All crops have failed.Vineyards dried up,fig trees withered,Pomegranates, date palms, and apple trees—deadwood everywhere!And joy is dried up and witheredin the hearts of the people.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>And also you priests,put on your robes and join the outcry.You who lead people in worship,lead them in lament.Spend the night dressed in gunnysacks,you servants of my God.Nothing’s going on in the place of worship,no offerings, no prayers—nothing.Declare a holy fast, call a special meeting,get the leaders together,Round up everyone in the country.Get them into <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Sanctuary for serious prayer to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-18 </sup>What a day! Doomsday!<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Judgment Day has come.The Strong God has arrived.This is serious business!Food is just a memory at our tables,as are joy and singing from God’s Sanctuary.The seeds in the field are dead,barns deserted,Grain silos abandoned.Who needs them? The crops have failed!The farm animals groan—oh, how they groan!The cattle mill around.There’s nothing for them to eat.Not even the sheep find anything.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-20 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>! I pray, I cry out to you!The fields are burning up,The country is a dust bowl,forest and prairie fires rage unchecked.Wild animals, dying of thirst,look to you for a drink.Springs and streams are dried up.The whole country is burning up."

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span><sup class=\"versenum mid-line\">1-3 </sup>Blow the ram’s horn trumpet in Zion!Trumpet the alarm on my holy mountain!Shake the country up!<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Judgment’s on its way—the Day’s almost here!A black day! A Doomsday!Clouds with no silver lining!Like dawn light moving over the mountains,a huge army is coming.There’s never been anything like itand never will be again.Wildfire burns everything before this armyand fire licks up everything in its wake.Before it arrives, the country is like the Garden of Eden.When it leaves, it is Death Valley.Nothing escapes unscathed.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-6 </sup>The locust army seems all horses—galloping horses, an army of horses.It sounds like thunderleaping on mountain ridges,Or like the roar of wildfirethrough grass and brush,Or like an invincible army shouting for blood,ready to fight, straining at the bit.At the sight of this army,the people panic, faces white with terror.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-11 </sup>The invaders charge.They climb barricades. Nothing stops them.Each soldier does what he’s told,so disciplined, so determined.They don’t get in each other’s way.Each one knows his job and does it.Undaunted and fearless,unswerving, unstoppable.They storm the city,swarm its defenses,Loot the houses,breaking down doors, smashing windows.They arrive like an earthquake,sweep through like a tornado.Sun and moon turn out their lights,stars black out.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> himself bellows in thunderas he commands his forces.Look at the size of that army!And the strength of those who obey him!<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Judgment Day—great and terrible.Who can possibly survive this?",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>But there’s also this, it’s not too late—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s personal Message!—“Come back to me and really mean it!Come fasting and weeping, sorry for your sins!”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>Change your life, not just your clothes.Come back to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, <i>your</i> God.And here’s why: God is kind and merciful.He takes a deep breath, puts up with a lot,This most patient God, extravagant in love,always ready to cancel catastrophe.Who knows? Maybe he’ll do it now,maybe he’ll turn around and show pity.Maybe, when all’s said and done,there’ll be blessings full and robust for your <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>!",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-17 </sup>Blow the ram’s horn trumpet in Zion!Declare a day of repentance, a holy fast day.Call a public meeting.Get everyone there. Consecrate the congregation.Make sure the elders come,but bring in the children, too, even the nursing babies,Even men and women on their honeymoon—interrupt them and get them there.Between Sanctuary entrance and altar,let the priests, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s servants, weep tears of repentance.Let them intercede: “Have mercy, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, on your people!Don’t abandon your heritage to contempt.Don’t let the pagans take over and rule themand sneer, ‘And so where is this God of theirs?’”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-20 </sup>At that, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> went into action to get his land back.He took pity on his people.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> answered and spoke to his people,“Look, listen—I’m sending a gift:Grain and wine and olive oil.The fast is over—eat your fill!I won’t expose you any longerto contempt among the pagans.I’ll head off the final enemy coming out of the northand dump them in a wasteland.Half of them will end up in the Dead Sea,the other half in the Mediterranean.There they’ll rot, a stench to high heaven.The bigger the enemy, the stronger the stench!”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-24 </sup>Fear not, Earth! Be glad and celebrate!<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has done great things.Fear not, wild animals!The fields and meadows are greening up.The trees are bearing fruit again:a bumper crop of fig trees and vines!Children of Zion, celebrate!Be glad in your <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.He’s giving you a teacherto train you how to live right—Teaching, like rain out of heaven, showers of wordsto refresh and nourish your soul, just as he used to do.And plenty of food for your body—silos full of grain,casks of wine and barrels of olive oil.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-27 </sup>“I’ll make up for the years of the locust,the great locust devastation—Locusts savage, locusts deadly,fierce locusts, locusts of doom,That great locust invasionI sent your way.You’ll eat your fill of good food.You’ll be full of praises to your <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>,The God who has set you back on your heels in wonder.Never again will my people be despised.You’ll know without questionthat I’m in the thick of life with Israel,That I’m your <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, yes, <i>your</i> <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>,the one and only real God.Never again will my people be despised.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28-32 </sup>“And that’s just the beginning: After that—“I will pour out my Spiriton every kind of people:Your sons will prophesy,also your daughters.Your old men will dream,your young men will see visions.I’ll even pour out my Spirit on the servants,men and women both.I’ll set wonders in the sky aboveand signs on the earth below:Blood and fire and billowing smoke,the sun turning black and the moon blood-red,Before the Judgment Day of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>,the Day tremendous and awesome.Whoever calls, ‘Help, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>!’gets help.On Mount Zion and in Jerusalemthere will be a great rescue—just as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said.Included in the survivorsare those that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> calls.”"

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span><sup class=\"versenum mid-line\">1-3 </sup>“In those days, yes, at that very timewhen I put life back together again for Judah and Jerusalem,I’ll assemble all the godless nations.I’ll lead them down into Judgment ValleyAnd put them all on trial, and judge them one and allbecause of their treatment of my own people Israel.They scattered my people all over the pagan worldand grabbed my land for themselves.They threw dice for my peopleand used them for barter.They would trade a boy for a whore,sell a girl for a bottle of wine when they wanted a drink.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-8 </sup>“As for you, Tyre and Sidon and Philistia,why should I bother with you?Are you trying to get back at mefor something I did to you?If you are, forget it.I’ll see to it that it boomerangs on you.You robbed me, cleaned me out of silver and gold,carted off everything valuable to furnish your own temples.You sold the people of Judah and Jerusaleminto slavery to the Greeks in faraway places.But I’m going to reverse your crime.I’m going to free those slaves.I’ll have done to you what you did to them:I’ll sell your children as slaves to your neighbors,And they’ll sell them to the far-off Sabeans.”<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Verdict.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-11 </sup>Announce this to the godless nations:Prepare for battle!Soldiers at attention!Present arms! Advance!Turn your shovels into swords,turn your hoes into spears.Let the weak one throw out his chestand say, “I’m tough, I’m a fighter.”Hurry up, pagans! Wherever you are, get a move on!Get your act together.Prepare to beshattered by <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>!",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Let the pagan nations set outfor Judgment Valley.There I’ll take my place at the benchand judge all the surrounding nations.",
