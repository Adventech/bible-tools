			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>On the first day of the sixth month of the second year in the reign of King Darius of Persia, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message was delivered by the prophet Haggai to the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and to the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak:",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>A Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies: “The people procrastinate. They say this isn’t the right time to rebuild my Temple, the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup>Shortly after that, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said more and Haggai spoke it: “How is it that it’s the ‘right time’ for you to live in your fine new homes while the Home, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Temple, is in ruins?”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>And then a little later, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies spoke out again:“Take a good, hard look at your life.Think it over.You have spent a lot of money,but you haven’t much to show for it.You keep filling your plates,but you never get filled up.You keep drinking and drinking and drinking,but you’re always thirsty.You put on layer after layer of clothes,but you can’t get warm.And the people who work for you,what are they getting out of it?Not much—a leaky, rusted-out bucket, that’s what.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>That’s why <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies said:“Take a good, hard look at your life.Think it over.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>Then <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said:“Here’s what I want you to do:Climb into the hills and cut some timber.Bring it down and rebuild the Temple.Do it just for me. Honor me.You’ve had great ambitions for yourselves,but nothing has come of it.The little you have brought to my TempleI’ve blown away—there was nothing to it.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-11 </sup>“And why?” (This is a Message from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies, remember.) “Because while you’ve run around, caught up with taking care of your own houses, my Home is in ruins. That’s why. Because of your stinginess. And so I’ve given you a dry summer and a skimpy crop. I’ve matched your tight-fisted stinginess by decreeing a season of drought, drying up fields and hills, withering gardens and orchards, stunting vegetables and fruit. Nothing—not man or woman, not animal or crop—is going to thrive.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Then the governor, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak, and all the people with them listened, really listened, to the voice of their <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. When <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> sent the prophet Haggai to them, they paid attention to him. In listening to Haggai, they honored <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then Haggai, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s messenger, preached <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message to the people: “I am with you!” <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Word.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>This is how <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> got Zerubbabel, Joshua, and all the people moving—got them working on the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies. This happened on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the Word of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> came through the prophet Haggai: “Tell Governor Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and High Priest Joshua son of Jehozadak and all the people: ‘Is there anyone here who saw the Temple the way it used to be, all glorious? And what do you see now? Not much, right?",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-5 </sup>“‘So get to work, Zerubbabel!’—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is speaking.“‘Get to work, Joshua son of Jehozadak—high priest!’“‘Get to work, all you people!’—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is speaking.“‘Yes, get to work! For I am with you.’ The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies is speaking! ‘Put into action the word I covenanted with you when you left Egypt. I’m living and breathing among you right now. Don’t be timid. Don’t hold back.’",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>“This is what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies said: ‘Before you know it, I will shake up sky and earth, ocean and fields. And I’ll shake down all the godless nations. They’ll bring bushels of wealth and I will fill this Temple with splendor.’ <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies says so.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>‘I own the silver,I own the gold.’Decree of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“‘This Temple is going to end up far better than it started out, a glorious beginning but an even more glorious finish: a place in which I will hand out wholeness and holiness.’ Decree of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-12 </sup>On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month (again, this was in the second year of Darius), <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message came to Haggai: “<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies speaks: Consult the priests for a ruling. If someone carries a piece of sacred meat in his pocket, meat that is set apart for sacrifice on the altar, and the pocket touches a loaf of bread, a dish of stew, a bottle of wine or oil, or any other food, will these foods be made holy by such contact?”The priests said, “No.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then Haggai said, “How about someone who is contaminated by touching a corpse—if that person touches one of these foods, will it be contaminated?”The priests said, “Yes, it will be contaminated.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then Haggai said, “‘So, this people is contaminated. Their nation is contaminated. Everything they do is contaminated. Whatever they do for me is contaminated.’ <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> says so.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-17 </sup>“‘Think back. Before you set out to lay the first foundation stones for the rebuilding of my Temple, how did it go with you? Isn’t it true that your foot-dragging, halfhearted efforts at rebuilding the Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> were reflected in a sluggish, halfway return on your crops—half the grain you were used to getting, half the wine? I hit you with drought and blight and hail. Everything you were doing got hit. But it didn’t seem to faze you. You continued to ignore me.’ <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Decree.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-19 </sup>“‘Now think ahead from this same date—this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Think ahead from when the Temple rebuilding was launched. Has anything in your fields—vine, fig tree, pomegranate, olive tree—failed to flourish? From now on you can count on a blessing.’”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message came a second time to Haggai on that most memorable day, the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month: “Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah:",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-23 </sup>“‘I am about to shake up everything, to turn everything upside down and start over from top to bottom—overthrow governments, destroy foreign powers, dismantle the world of weapons and armaments, throw armies into confusion, so that they end up killing one another. And on that day’”—this is <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message—“‘I will take you, O Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, as my personal servant and I will set you as a signet ring, the sign of my sovereign presence and authority. I’ve looked over the field and chosen you for this work.’” The Message of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies."
