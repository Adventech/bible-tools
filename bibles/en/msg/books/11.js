			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-4 </sup>King David grew old. The years had caught up with him. Even though they piled blankets on him, he couldn’t keep warm. So his servants said to him, “We’re going to get a young virgin for our master the king to be at his side and look after him; she’ll get in bed with you and arouse our master the king.” So they searched the country of Israel for the most ravishing girl they could find; they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king. The girl was stunningly beautiful; she stayed at his side and looked after the king, but the king did not have sex with her.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>At this time Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, puffed himself up saying, “I’m the next king!” He made quite a splash, with chariots and riders and fifty men to run ahead of him. His father had spoiled him rotten as a child, never once reprimanding him. Besides that, he was very good-looking and the next in line after Absalom.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-8 </sup>Adonijah talked with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they threw their weight on his side. But neither the priest Zadok, nor Benaiah son of Jehoiada, nor Nathan the prophet, nor Shimei and Rei, nor David’s personal bodyguards supported Adonijah.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>Next Adonijah held a coronation feast, sacrificing sheep, cattle, and grain-fed heifers at the Stone of Zoheleth near the Rogel Spring. He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and everyone in Judah who had position and influence—but he did not invite the prophet Nathan, Benaiah, the bodyguards, or his brother Solomon.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-14 </sup>Nathan went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Did you know that Adonijah, Haggith’s son, has taken over as king, and our master David doesn’t know a thing about it? Quickly now, let me tell you how you can save both your own life and Solomon’s. Go immediately to King David. Speak up: ‘Didn’t you, my master the king, promise me, “Your son Solomon will be king after me and sit on my throne”? So why is Adonijah now king?’ While you’re there talking with the king, I’ll come in and corroborate your story.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>Bathsheba went at once to the king in his palace bedroom. He was so old! Abishag was at his side making him comfortable. As Bathsheba bowed low, honoring the king, he said, “What do you want?”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-21 </sup>“My master,” she said, “you promised me in <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s name, ‘Your son Solomon will be king after me and sit on my throne.’ And now look what’s happened—Adonijah has taken over as king, and my master the king doesn’t even know it! He has thrown a huge coronation feast—cattle and grain-fed heifers and sheep—inviting all the king’s sons, the priest Abiathar, and Joab head of the army. But your servant Solomon was <i>not</i> invited. My master the king, every eye in Israel is watching you to see what you’ll do—to see who will sit on the throne of my master the king after him. If you fail to act, the moment you’re buried my son Solomon and I are as good as dead.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>Abruptly, while she was telling the king all this, Nathan the prophet came in and was announced: “Nathan the prophet is here.” He came before the king, honoring him by bowing deeply, his face touching the ground.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-27 </sup>“My master the king,” Nathan began, “did you say, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me and sit on my throne’? Because that’s what’s happening. He’s thrown a huge coronation feast—cattle, grain-fed heifers, sheep—inviting all the king’s sons, the army officers, and Abiathar the priest. They’re having a grand time, eating and drinking and shouting, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ But I wasn’t invited, nor was the priest Zadok, nor Benaiah son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. Is this something that my master the king has done behind our backs, not telling your servants who you intended to be king after you?”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>King David took action: “Get Bathsheba back in here.” She entered and stood before the king.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29-30 </sup>The king solemnly promised, “As <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> lives, the God who delivered me from every kind of trouble, I’ll do exactly what I promised in <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s name, the God of Israel: Your son Solomon will be king after me and take my place on the throne. And I’ll make sure it happens this very day.”",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Bathsheba bowed low, her face to the ground. Kneeling in reverence before the king she said, “Oh, may my master, King David, live forever!”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>King David said, “Call Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” They came to the king.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33-35 </sup>Then he ordered, “Gather my servants, then mount my son Solomon on my royal mule and lead him in procession down to Gihon. When you get there, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet will anoint him king over Israel. Then blow the ram’s horn trumpet and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ You will then accompany him as he enters and takes his place on my throne, succeeding me as king. I have named him ruler over Israel and Judah.”",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36-37 </sup>Benaiah son of Jehoiada backed the king: “Yes! And may <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the God of my master the king, confirm it! Just as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has been with my master the king, may he also be with Solomon and make his rule even greater than that of my master King David!”",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38-40 </sup>Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the king’s personal bodyguard (the Kerethites and Pelethites) went down, mounted Solomon on King David’s mule, and paraded with him to Gihon. Zadok the priest brought a flask of oil from the sanctuary and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram’s horn trumpet and everyone shouted, “Long live King Solomon!” Everyone joined the fanfare, the band playing and the people singing, the very earth reverberating to the sound.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Adonijah and his retinue of guests were just finishing their “coronation” feast when they heard it. When Joab heard the blast of the ram’s horn trumpet he said, “What’s going on here? What’s all this uproar?”",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>Suddenly, in the midst of the questioning, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest, showed up. Adonijah said, “Welcome! A brave and good man like you must have good news.”",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43-48 </sup>But Jonathan answered, “Hardly! Our master King David has just made Solomon king! And the king has surrounded him with Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, with the Kerethites and Pelethites; and they’ve mounted Solomon on the royal mule. Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon and the parade is headed up this way singing—a great fanfare! The city is rocking! That’s what you’re hearing. Here’s the crowning touch—Solomon is seated on the throne of the kingdom! And that’s not all: The king’s servants have come to give their blessing to our master King David saying, ‘God make Solomon’s name even more honored than yours, and make his rule greater than yours!’ On his deathbed the king worshiped God and prayed, ‘Blessed be <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, Israel’s God, who has provided a successor to my throne, and I’ve lived to see it!’”",
			"49": "<sup class=\"versenum\">49-50 </sup>Panicked, Adonijah’s guests got out of there, scattering every which way. But Adonijah himself, afraid for his life because of Solomon, fled to the sanctuary and grabbed the horns of the Altar.",
			"51": "<sup class=\"versenum\">51 </sup>Solomon was told, “Adonijah, fearful of King Solomon, has taken sanctuary and seized the horns of the Altar and is saying, ‘I’m not leaving until King Solomon promises that he won’t kill me.’”",
			"52": "<sup class=\"versenum\">52-53 </sup>Solomon then said, “If he proves to be a man of honor, not a hair of his head will be hurt; but if there is evil in him, he’ll die.” Solomon summoned him and they brought him from the Altar. Adonijah came and bowed down, honoring the king. Solomon dismissed him, “Go home.”"

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-4 </sup>When David’s time to die approached, he charged his son Solomon, saying, “I’m about to go the way of all the earth, but you—be strong; show what you’re made of! Do what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> tells you. Walk in the paths he shows you: Follow the life-map absolutely, keep an eye out for the signposts, his course for life set out in the revelation to Moses; then you’ll get on well in whatever you do and wherever you go. Then <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> will confirm what he promised me when he said, ‘If your sons watch their step, staying true to me heart and soul, you’ll always have a successor on Israel’s throne.’",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>“And don’t forget what Joab son of Zeruiah did to the two commanders of Israel’s army, to Abner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Jether. He murdered them in cold blood, acting in peacetime as if he were at war, and has been stained with that blood ever since. Do what you think best with him, but by no means let him get off scot-free—make him pay.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>“But be generous to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite—extend every hospitality to them; that’s the way they treated me when I was running for my life from Absalom your brother.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>“You also will have to deal with Shimei son of Gera the Benjaminite from Bahurim, the one who cursed me so viciously when I was on my way to Mahanaim. Later, when he welcomed me back at the Jordan, I promised him under <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, ‘I won’t put you to death.’ But neither should you treat him as if nothing ever happened. You’re wise, you know how to handle these things. You’ll know what to do to make him pay before he dies.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-12 </sup>Then David joined his ancestors. He was buried in the City of David. David ruled Israel for forty years—seven years in Hebron and another thirty-three in Jerusalem. Solomon took over on the throne of his father David; he had a firm grip on the kingdom.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>Adonijah son of Haggith came to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. She said, “Do you come in peace?”He said, “In peace.” And then, “May I say something to you?”“Go ahead,” she said, “speak.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>“You know that I had the kingdom right in my hands and everyone expected me to be king, and then the whole thing backfired and the kingdom landed in my brother’s lap—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s doing. So now I have one request to ask of you; please don’t refuse me.”“Go ahead, ask,” she said.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>“Ask King Solomon—he won’t turn <i>you</i> down—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>“Certainly,” said Bathsheba. “I’ll speak to the king for you.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Bathsheba went to King Solomon to present Adonijah’s request. The king got up and welcomed her, bowing respectfully, and returned to his throne. Then he had a throne put in place for his mother, and she sat at his right hand.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>She said, “I have a small favor to ask of you. Don’t refuse me.”The king replied, “Go ahead, Mother; of course I won’t refuse you.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>She said, “Give Abishag the Shunammite to your brother Adonijah as his wife.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>King Solomon answered his mother, “What kind of favor is this, asking that Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah? Why don’t you just ask me to hand over the whole kingdom to him on a platter since he is my older brother and has Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah on his side!”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-24 </sup>Then King Solomon swore under <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, “May God do his worst to me if Adonijah doesn’t pay for this with his life! As surely as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> lives, the God who has set me firmly on the throne of my father David and has put me in charge of the kingdom just as he promised, Adonijah will die for this—today!”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>King Solomon dispatched Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he struck Adonijah and he died.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>The king then told Abiathar the priest, “You’re exiled to your place in Anathoth. You deserve death but I’m not going to kill you—for now anyway—because you were in charge of the Chest of our ruling <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> in the company of David my father, and because you shared all the hard times with my father.”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Solomon stripped Abiathar of his priesthood, fulfilling <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s word at Shiloh regarding the family of Eli.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28-29 </sup>When this news reached Joab, this Joab who had conspired with Adonijah (although he had remained loyal in the Absalom affair), he took refuge in the sanctuary of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, seizing the horns of the Altar and holding on for dear life. King Solomon was told that Joab had escaped to the sanctuary of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> and was clinging to the Altar; he immediately sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada with orders, “Kill him.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>Benaiah went to the sanctuary of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> and said, “King’s orders: Come out.”He said, “No—I’ll die right here.”Benaiah went back to the king and reported, “This was Joab’s answer.”",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31-33 </sup>The king said, “Go ahead then, do what he says: Kill him and bury him. Absolve me and my father’s family of the guilt from Joab’s senseless murders. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is avenging those bloody murders on Joab’s head. Two men he murdered, men better by far than he ever was: Behind my father’s back he brutally murdered Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army. Responsibility for their murders is forever fixed on Joab and his descendants; but for David and his descendants, his family and kingdom, the final verdict is <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s peace.”",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34-35 </sup>So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went back, struck Joab, and killed him. He was buried in his family plot out in the desert. The king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36-37 </sup>The king next called in Shimei and told him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but you are not to leave the area. If you so much as cross the Brook Kidron, you’re as good as dead—you will have decreed your own death sentence.”",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Shimei answered the king, “Oh, thank you! Your servant will do exactly as my master the king says.” Shimei lived in Jerusalem a long time.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39-40 </sup>But it so happened that three years later, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. Shimei was told, “Your slaves are in Gath.” Shimei sprang into action, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish in Gath looking for his slaves. And then he came back, bringing his slaves.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Solomon was told, “Shimei left Jerusalem for Gath, and now he’s back.”",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42-43 </sup>Solomon then called for Shimei and said, “Didn’t I make you promise me under <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, and give you a good warning besides, that you would not leave this area? That if you left you would have decreed your own death sentence? And didn’t you say, ‘Oh, thank you—I’ll do exactly as you say’? So why didn’t you keep your sacred promise and do what I ordered?”",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44-45 </sup>Then the king told Shimei, “Deep in your heart you know all the evil that you did to my father David; <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> will now avenge that evil on you. But King Solomon will be blessed and the rule of David will be a sure thing under <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> forever.”",
			"46": "<sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>The king then gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he went out and struck Shimei dead.The kingdom was now securely in Solomon’s grasp."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>Solomon arranged a marriage contract with Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He married Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her to the City of David until he had completed building his royal palace and <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Temple and the wall around Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the people were worshiping at local shrines because at that time no temple had yet been built to the Name of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Solomon loved <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> and continued to live in the God-honoring ways of David his father, except that he also worshiped at the local shrines, offering sacrifices and burning incense.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-5 </sup>The king went to Gibeon, the most prestigious of the local shrines, to worship. He sacrificed a thousand Whole-Burnt-Offerings on that altar. That night, there in Gibeon, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> appeared to Solomon in a dream: God said, “What can I give you? Ask.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Solomon said, “You were extravagantly generous in love with David my father, and he lived faithfully in your presence, his relationships were just and his heart right. And you have persisted in this great and generous love by giving him—and this very day!—a son to sit on his throne.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-8 </sup>“And now here I am: <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, my God, you have made me, your servant, ruler of the kingdom in place of David my father. I’m too young for this, a mere child! I don’t know the ropes, hardly know the ‘ins’ and ‘outs’ of this job. And here I am, set down in the middle of the people you’ve chosen, a great people—far too many to ever count.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“Here’s what I want: Give me a God-listening heart so I can lead your people well, discerning the difference between good and evil. For who on their own is capable of leading your glorious people?”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-14 </sup>God, the Master, was delighted with Solomon’s response. And God said to him, “Because you have asked for this and haven’t grasped after a long life, or riches, or the doom of your enemies, but you have asked for the ability to lead and govern well, I’ll give you what you’ve asked for—I’m giving you a wise and mature heart. There’s never been one like you before; and there’ll be no one after. As a bonus, I’m giving you both the wealth and glory you didn’t ask for—there’s not a king anywhere who will come up to your mark. And if you stay on course, keeping your eye on the life-map and the God-signs as your father David did, I’ll also give you a long life.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Solomon woke up—what a dream! He returned to Jerusalem, took his place before the Chest of the Covenant of God, and worshiped by sacrificing Whole-Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings. Then he laid out a banquet for everyone in his service.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-21 </sup>The very next thing, two prostitutes showed up before the king. The one woman said, “My master, this woman and I live in the same house. While we were living together, I had a baby. Three days after I gave birth, this woman also had a baby. We were alone—there wasn’t anyone else in the house except for the two of us. The infant son of this woman died one night when she rolled over on him in her sleep. She got up in the middle of the night and took my son—I was sound asleep, mind you!—and put him at her breast and put her dead son at my breast. When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, here was this dead baby! But when I looked at him in the morning light, I saw immediately that he wasn’t my baby.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>“Not so!” said the other woman. “The living one’s mine; the dead one’s yours.”The first woman countered, “No! Your son’s the dead one; mine’s the living one.”They went back and forth this way in front of the king.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>The king said, “What are we to do? This woman says, ‘The living son is mine and the dead one is yours,’ and this woman says, ‘No, the dead one’s yours and the living one’s mine.’”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>After a moment the king said, “Bring me a sword.” They brought the sword to the king.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Then he said, “Cut the living baby in two—give half to one and half to the other.”",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>The real mother of the living baby was overcome with emotion for her son and said, “Oh no, master! Give her the whole baby alive; don’t kill him!”But the other one said, “If I can’t have him, you can’t have him—cut away!”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>The king gave his decision: “Give the living baby to the first woman. Nobody is going to kill this baby. She is the real mother.”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>The word got around—everyone in Israel heard of the king’s judgment. They were all in awe of the king, realizing that it was God’s wisdom that enabled him to judge truly."

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-19 </sup>Solomon had twelve regional managers distributed throughout Israel. They were responsible for supplying provisions for the king and his administration. Each was in charge of bringing supplies for one month of the year. These are the names:Ben-Hur in the Ephraim hills;Ben-Deker in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Bethhanan;Ben-Hesed in Arubboth—this included Socoh and all of Hepher;Ben-Abinadab in Naphoth Dor (he was married to Solomon’s daughter Taphath);Baana son of Ahilud in Taanach and Megiddo, all of Beth Shan next to Zarethan below Jezreel, and from Beth Shan to Abel Meholah over to Jokmeam;Ben-Geber in Ramoth Gilead—this included the villages of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead and the region of Argob in Bashan with its sixty large walled cities with bronze-studded gates;Ahinadab son of Iddo in Mahanaim;Ahimaaz in Naphtali (he was married to Solomon’s daughter Basemath);Baana son of Hushai in Asher and Aloth;Jehoshaphat son of Paruah in Issachar;Shimei son of Ela in Benjamin;Geber son of Uri in Gilead—this was the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and also of Og king of Bashan; he managed the whole district by himself.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>Judah and Israel were densely populated—like sand on an ocean beach! All their needs were met; they ate and drank and were happy. Solomon was sovereign over all the kingdoms from the River Euphrates in the east to the country of the Philistines in the west, all the way to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and were vassals of Solomon all his life.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>One day’s food supply for Solomon’s household was:185 bushels of fine flour375 bushels of meal10 grain-fed cattle20 range cattle100 sheepand miscellaneous deer, gazelles, roebucks, and choice fowl.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>Solomon was sovereign over everything, countries and kings, west of the River Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza. Peace reigned everywhere. Throughout Solomon’s life, everyone in Israel and Judah lived safe and sound, all of them from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south—content with what they had.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26-28 </sup>Solomon had forty thousand stalls for chariot horses and twelve thousand horsemen. The district managers, each according to his assigned month, delivered food supplies for King Solomon and all who sat at the king’s table; there was always plenty. They also brought to the designated place their assigned quota of barley and straw for the horses.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29-34 </sup>God gave Solomon wisdom—the deepest of understanding and the largest of hearts. There was nothing beyond him, nothing he couldn’t handle. Solomon’s wisdom outclassed the vaunted wisdom of wise men of the East, outshone the famous wisdom of Egypt. He was wiser than anyone—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, wiser than Heman, wiser than Calcol and Darda the sons of Mahol. He became famous among all the surrounding nations. He created 3,000 proverbs; his songs added up to 1,005. He knew all about plants, from the huge cedar that grows in Lebanon to the tiny hyssop that grows in the cracks of a wall. He understood everything about animals and birds, reptiles and fish. Sent by kings from all over the earth who had heard of his reputation, people came from far and near to listen to the wisdom of Solomon."

Hiram had loved David his whole life. Solomon responded, saying, “You know that David my father was not able to build a temple in honor of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> because of the wars he had to fight on all sides, until <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> finally put them down.

My lumberjacks will haul the timbers from the Lebanon forest to the sea, assemble them into log rafts, float them to the place you set, then have them disassembled for you to haul away. All I want from you is that you feed my crew.”",

Solomon also had seventy thousand unskilled workers and another eighty thousand stonecutters up in the hills—plus thirty-three hundred foremen managing the project and supervising the work crews. Following the king’s orders, they quarried huge blocks of the best stone—dressed stone for the foundation of The Temple. Solomon and Hiram’s construction workers, assisted by the men of Gebal, cut and prepared the timber and stone for building The Temple."

The Temple that King Solomon built to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> was ninety feet long, thirty feet wide, and forty-five feet high. There was a porch across the thirty-foot width of The Temple that extended out fifteen feet. Within The Temple he made narrow, deep-silled windows. Against the outside walls he built a supporting structure in which there were smaller rooms: The lower floor was seven and a half feet wide, the middle floor nine feet, and the third floor ten and a half feet. He had projecting ledges built into the outside Temple walls to support the buttressing beams.",

The thirty feet at the rear of The Temple he made into an Inner Sanctuary, cedar planks from floor to ceiling—the Holy of Holies. The Main Sanctuary area in front was sixty feet long. The entire interior of The Temple was cedar, with carvings of fruits and flowers. All cedar—none of the stone was exposed.",

The outstretched wings of the cherubim (they were identical in size and shape) measured another fifteen feet. He placed the two cherubim, their wings spread, in the Inner Sanctuary. The combined wingspread stretched the width of the room, the wing of one cherub touched one wall, the wing of the other the other wall, and the wings touched in the middle. The cherubim were gold-plated.",

He then cast two capitals in bronze to set on the pillars; each capital was seven and a half feet high and flared at the top in the shape of a lily. Each capital was dressed with an elaborate filigree of seven braided chains and a double row of two hundred pomegranates, setting the pillars off magnificently. He set the pillars up in the entrance porch to The Temple; the pillar to the south he named Security (Jachin) and the pillar to the north Stability (Boaz). The capitals were in the shape of lilies.",

They were made like this: Panels were fastened to the uprights. Lions, bulls, and cherubim were represented on the panels and uprights. Beveled wreath-work bordered the lions and bulls above and below. Each stand was mounted on four bronze wheels with bronze axles. The uprights were cast with decorative relief work. Each stand held a basin on a circular engraved support a foot and a half deep set on a pedestal two and a quarter feet square. The washstand itself was square. The axles were attached under the stand and the wheels fixed to them. The wheels were twenty-seven inches in diameter; they were designed like chariot wheels. Everything—axles, rims, spokes, and hubs—was of cast metal.",

Hiram then fashioned the various utensils: buckets and shovels and bowls.",

She came to Solomon and talked about all the things that she cared about, emptying her heart to him. Solomon answered everything she put to him—nothing stumped him. When the queen of Sheba experienced for herself Solomon’s wisdom and saw with her own eyes the palace he had built, the meals that were served, the impressive array of court officials and sharply dressed waiters, the lavish crystal, and the elaborate worship extravagant with Whole-Burnt-Offerings at the steps leading up to The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, it took her breath away.",

Joab and his army stayed there for six months, making sure they had killed every man in Edom. Hadad, just a boy at the time, had escaped with some of the Edomites who had worked for his father. Their escape route took them through Midian to Paran. They picked up some men in Paran and went on to Egypt and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house, food, and even land. Pharaoh liked him so well that he gave him the sister of his wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage. She bore Hadad a son named Genubath who was raised like one of the royal family.

Solomon had built the outer defense system (the Millo) and had restored the fortifications that were in disrepair from the time of his father David.

Jeroboam built forbidden shrines all over the place and recruited priests from wherever he could find them, regardless of whether they were fit for the job or not.

He staffed Bethel with priests from the local shrines he had made.

It wasn’t enough for him to copy the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat; no, he went all out, first by marrying Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and then by serving and worshiping the god Baal. He built a temple for Baal in Samaria, and then furnished it with an altar for Baal. Worse, he went on and built a shrine to the sacred whore Asherah.

As surely as your <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> lives, there isn’t a country or kingdom where my master hasn’t sent out search parties looking for you. And if they said, ‘We can’t find him; we’ve looked high and low,’ he would make that country or kingdom swear that you were not to be found. And now you’re telling me, ‘Go and tell your master Elijah’s found!’ The minute I leave you the Spirit of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> will whisk you away to who knows where. Then when I report to Ahab, you’ll have disappeared and Ahab will kill me. And I’ve served <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> devoutly since I was a boy! Hasn’t anyone told you what I did when Jezebel was out to kill the prophets of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, how I risked my life by hiding a hundred of them, fifty to a cave, and made sure they got food and water? And now you’re telling me to draw attention to myself by announcing to my master, ‘Elijah’s been found.’ Why, he’ll kill me for sure.”",

Here’s what I want you to do: Assemble everyone in Israel at Mount Carmel. And make sure that the special pets of Jezebel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of the local gods, the Baals, and the four hundred prophets of the whore goddess Asherah, are there.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>So Ahab summoned everyone in Israel, particularly the prophets, to Mount Carmel.",

Maybe he’s off meditating somewhere or other, or maybe he’s gotten involved in a project, or maybe he’s on vacation. You don’t suppose he’s overslept, do you, and needs to be waked up?” They prayed louder and louder, cutting themselves with swords and knives—a ritual common to them—until they were covered with blood.",

			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30-35 </sup>Then Elijah told the people, “Enough of that—it’s my turn. Gather around.” And they gathered. He then put the altar back together for by now it was in ruins. Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes of Jacob, the same Jacob to whom <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had said, “From now on your name is Israel.” He built the stones into the altar in honor of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Then Elijah dug a fairly wide trench around the altar. He laid firewood on the altar, cut up the ox, put it on the wood, and said, “Fill four buckets with water and drench both the ox and the firewood.” Then he said, “Do it again,” and they did it. Then he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time. The altar was drenched and the trench was filled with water.",

			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Immediately the fire of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> fell and burned up the offering, the wood, the stones, the dirt, and even the water in the trench.",

			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42-43 </sup>Ahab did it: got up and ate and drank. Meanwhile, Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bowed deeply in prayer, his face between his knees. Then he said to his young servant, “On your feet now! Look toward the sea.”He went, looked, and reported back, “I don’t see a thing.”“Keep looking,” said Elijah, “seven times if necessary.”",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>And sure enough, the seventh time he said, “Oh yes, a cloud! But very small, no bigger than someone’s hand, rising out of the sea.”“Quickly then, on your way. Tell Ahab, ‘Saddle up and get down from the mountain before the rain stops you.’”",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45-46 </sup>Things happened fast. The sky grew black with wind-driven clouds, and then a huge cloudburst of rain, with Ahab hightailing it in his chariot for Jezreel.

He left his young servant there and then went on into the desert another day’s journey.

Anyone who escapes death by Hazael will be killed by Jehu; and anyone who escapes death by Jehu will be killed by Elisha.

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The king of Israel countered, “Think about it—it’s easier to start a fight than end one.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>It happened that when Ben-Hadad heard this retort he was into some heavy drinking, boozing it up with the sheiks in their field shelters. Drunkenly, he ordered his henchmen, “Go after them!” And they attacked the city.",

The commandos of the regional chiefs made up the vanguard.A report was brought to Ben-Hadad: “Men are on their way from Samaria.”",

So let’s engage them on the plain where we’ll have the advantage. Here’s the strategy: Remove each sheik from his place of leadership and replace him with a seasoned officer. Then recruit a fighting force equivalent in size to the army that deserted earlier—horse for horse, chariot for chariot. And we’ll fight them on the plain—we’re sure to prove stronger than they are.”It sounded good to the king; he did what they advised.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26-27 </sup>As the new year approached, Ben-Hadad rallied Aram and they went up to Aphek to make war on Israel. The Israelite army prepared to fight and took the field to meet Aram. They moved into battle formation before Aram in two camps, like two flocks of goats. The plain was seething with Arameans.",

			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30-31 </sup>Ben-Hadad escaped into the city and hid in a closet. Then his advisors told him, “Look, we’ve heard that the kings of Israel play by the rules; let’s dress in old gunnysacks, carry a white flag of truce, and present ourselves to the king of Israel on the chance that he’ll let you live.”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>So that’s what they did. They dressed in old gunnysacks and carried a white flag, and came to the king of Israel saying, “Your servant Ben-Hadad said, ‘Please let me live.’”Ahab said, “You mean to tell me that he’s still alive? If he’s alive, he’s my brother.”",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>The men took this as a good sign and concluded that everything was going to be all right: “Ben-Hadad is most certainly your brother!”The king said, “Go and get him.” They went and brought him back by chariot.",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Ahab said, “I am prepared to return the cities that my father took from your father. And you can set up your headquarters in Damascus just as my father did in Samaria; I’ll send you home under safe conduct.” Then he made a covenant with him and sent him off.",

			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>So he told him, “Because you wouldn’t obey <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s orders, as soon as you leave me a lion will attack you.” No sooner had the man left his side than a lion met him and attacked.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>He then found another man and said, “Hit me; wound me.” That man did it—hit him hard in the face, drawing blood.",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38-40 </sup>Then the prophet went and took a position along the road, with a bandage over his eyes, waiting for the king. It wasn’t long before the king happened by. The man cried out to the king, “Your servant was in the thick of the battle when a man showed up and turned over a prisoner to me, saying, ‘Guard this man with your life; if he turns up missing you’ll pay dearly.’ But I got busy doing one thing after another and the next time I looked he was gone.”The king of Israel said, “You’ve just pronounced your own verdict.”",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>At that, the man ripped the bandage off his eyes and the king recognized who he was—one of the prophets!",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>The man said to the king, “<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s word: Because you let a man go who was under sentence by <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, it’s now your life for his, your people for his.”",

In exchange I’ll give you a far better vineyard, or if you’d prefer I’ll pay you money for it.”",

They called for a fast day and seated Naboth at the head table. Then they brought in two stool pigeons and seated them opposite Naboth. In front of everybody the two degenerates accused him, “He blasphemed God and the king!” The company threw him out in the street, stoned him mercilessly, and he died.",
