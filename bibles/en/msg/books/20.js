You’ll call for me, but don’t expectan answer.No matter how hard you look, you won’t find me.",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-15 </sup>So now you can pick out what’s true and fair,find all the good trails!Lady Wisdom will be your close friend,and Brother Knowledge your pleasant companion.Good Sense will scout ahead for danger,Insight will keep an eye out for you.They’ll keep you from making wrong turns,or following the bad directionsOf those who are lost themselvesand can’t tell a trail from a tumbleweed,These losers who make a game of eviland throw parties to celebrate perversity,Traveling paths that go nowhere,wandering in a maze of detours and dead ends.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-19 </sup>Wise friends will rescue you from the Temptress—that smooth-talking SeductressWho’s faithless to the husband she married years ago,never gave a second thought to her promises before God.Her whole way of life is doomed;every step she takes brings her closer to hell.No one who joins her company ever comes back,ever sets foot on the path to real living.",

Because <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> can’t stand twisted souls.It’s the straightforward who get his respect.",

Do what I tell you—live!Sell everything and buy Wisdom! Forage for Understanding!Don’t forget one word! Don’t deviate an inch!Never walk away from Wisdom—she guards your life;love her—she keeps her eye on you.Above all and before all, do this: Get Wisdom!Write this at the top of your list: Get Understanding!Throw your arms around her—believe me, you won’t regret it;never let her go—she’ll make your life glorious.She’ll garland your life with grace,she’ll festoon your days with beauty.”",

			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-35 </sup>They’ll protect you from wanton women,from the seductive talk of some temptress.Don’t lustfully fantasize on her beauty,nor be taken in by her bedroom eyes.You can buy an hour with a whore for a loaf of bread,but a wanton woman may well eat <i>you</i> alive.Can you build a fire in your lapand not burn your pants?Can you walk barefoot on hot coalsand not get blisters?It’s the same when you have sex with your neighbor’s wife:Touch her and you’ll pay for it. No excuses.Hunger is no excusefor a thief to steal;When he’s caught he has to pay it back,even if he has to put his whole house in hock.Adultery is a brainless act,soul-destroying, self-destructive;Expect a bloody nose, a black eye,and a reputation ruined for good.For jealousy detonates rage in a cheated husband;wild for revenge, he won’t make allowances.Nothing you say or pay will make it all right;neither bribes nor reason will satisfy him."

			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-12 </sup>As I stood at the window of my houselooking out through the shutters,Watching the mindless crowd stroll by,I spotted a young man without any senseArriving at the corner of the street where she lived,then turning up the path to her house.It was dusk, the evening coming on,the darkness thickening into night.Just then, a woman met him—she’d been lying in wait for him, dressed to seduce him.Brazen and brash she was,restless and roaming, never at home,Walking the streets, loitering in the mall,hanging out at every corner in town.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-20 </sup>She threw her arms around him and kissed him,boldly took his arm and said,“I’ve got all the makings for a feast—today I made my offerings, my vows are all paid,So now I’ve come to find you,hoping to catch sight of your face—and here you are!I’ve spread fresh, clean sheets on my bed,colorful imported linens.My bed is aromatic with spicesand exotic fragrances.Come, let’s make love all night,spend the night in ecstatic lovemaking!My husband’s not home; he’s away on business,and he won’t be back for a month.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-23 </sup>Soon she has him eating out of her hand,bewitched by her honeyed speech.Before you know it, he’s trotting behind her,like a calf led to the butcher shop,Like a stag lured into ambushand then shot with an arrow,Like a bird flying into a netnot knowing that its flying life is over.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-27 </sup>So, friends, listen to me,take these words of mine most seriously.Don’t fool around with a woman like that;don’t even stroll through her neighborhood.Countless victims come under her spell;she’s the death of many a poor man.She runs a halfway house to hell,fits you out with a shroud and a coffin."
