			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-9 </sup>After the death of Moses the servant of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> spoke to Joshua, Moses’ assistant:“Moses my servant is dead. Get going. Cross this Jordan River, you and all the people. Cross to the country I’m giving to the People of Israel. I’m giving you every square inch of the land you set your foot on—just as I promised Moses. From the wilderness and this Lebanon east to the Great River, the Euphrates River—all the Hittite country—and then west to the Great Sea. It’s all yours. All your life, no one will be able to hold out against you. In the same way I was with Moses, I’ll be with you. I won’t give up on you; I won’t leave you. Strength! Courage! You are going to lead this people to inherit the land that I promised to give their ancestors. Give it everything you have, heart and soul. Make sure you carry out The Revelation that Moses commanded you, every bit of it. Don’t get off track, either left or right, so as to make sure you get to where you’re going. And don’t for a minute let this Book of The Revelation be out of mind. Ponder and meditate on it day and night, making sure you practice everything written in it. Then you’ll get where you’re going; then you’ll succeed. Haven’t I commanded you? Strength! Courage! Don’t be timid; don’t get discouraged. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, is with you every step you take.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-11 </sup>Then Joshua gave orders to the people’s leaders: “Go through the camp and give this order to the people: ‘Pack your bags. In three days you will cross this Jordan River to enter and take the land <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, is giving you to possess.’”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-15 </sup>Then Joshua addressed the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. He said, “Remember what Moses the servant of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> commanded you: <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, gives you rest and he gives you this land. Your wives, your children, and your livestock can stay here east of the Jordan, the country Moses gave you; but you, tough soldiers all, must cross the River in battle formation, leading your brothers, helping them until <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, gives your brothers a place of rest just as he has done for you. They also will take possession of the land that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, is giving them. Then you will be free to return to your possession, given to you by Moses the servant of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, across the Jordan to the east.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-18 </sup>They answered Joshua: “Everything you commanded us, we’ll do. Wherever you send us, we’ll go. We obeyed Moses to the letter; we’ll also obey you—we just pray that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, will be with you as he was with Moses. Anyone who questions what you say and refuses to obey whatever you command him will be put to death. Strength! Courage!”"

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>Joshua son of Nun secretly sent out from Shittim two men as spies: “Go. Look over the land. Check out Jericho.” They left and arrived at the house of a harlot named Rahab and stayed there.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The king of Jericho was told, “We’ve just learned that men arrived tonight to spy out the land. They’re from the People of Israel.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The king of Jericho sent word to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you to stay the night in your house. They’re spies; they’ve come to spy out the whole country.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-7 </sup>The woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, two men did come to me, but I didn’t know where they’d come from. At dark, when the gate was about to be shut, the men left. But I have no idea where they went. Hurry up! Chase them—you can still catch them!” (She had actually taken them up on the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax that were spread out for her on the roof.) So the men set chase down the Jordan road toward the fords. As soon as they were gone, the gate was shut.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-11 </sup>Before the spies were down for the night, the woman came up to them on the roof and said, “I know that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has given you the land. We’re all afraid. Everyone in the country feels hopeless. We heard how <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you left Egypt, and what he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you put under a holy curse and destroyed. We heard it and our hearts sank. We all had the wind knocked out of us. And all because of you, you and <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, God of the heavens above and God of the earth below.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>“Now promise me by <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. I showed you mercy; now show my family mercy. And give me some tangible proof, a guarantee of life for my father and mother, my brothers and sisters—everyone connected with my family. Save our souls from death!”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>“Our lives for yours!” said the men. “But don’t tell anyone our business. When <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> turns this land over to us, we’ll do right by you in loyal mercy.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>She lowered them down out a window with a rope because her house was on the city wall to the outside. She told them, “Run for the hills so your pursuers won’t find you. Hide out for three days and give your pursuers time to return. Then get on your way.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-20 </sup>The men told her, “In order to keep this oath you made us swear, here is what you must do: Hang this red rope out the window through which you let us down and gather your entire family with you in your house—father, mother, brothers, and sisters. Anyone who goes out the doors of your house into the street and is killed, it’s his own fault—we aren’t responsible. But for everyone within the house we take full responsibility. If anyone lays a hand on one of them, it’s our fault. But if you tell anyone of our business here, the oath you made us swear is canceled—we’re no longer responsible.”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>She said, “If that’s what you say, that’s the way it is,” and sent them off. They left and she hung the red rope out the window.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>They headed for the hills and stayed there for three days until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers had looked high and low but found nothing.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-24 </sup>The men headed back. They came down out of the hills, crossed the river, and returned to Joshua son of Nun and reported all their experiences. They told Joshua, “Yes! <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has given the whole country to us. Everybody there is in a state of panic because of us.”"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-4 </sup>Joshua was up early and on his way from Shittim with all the People of Israel with him. He arrived at the Jordan and camped before crossing over. After three days, leaders went through the camp and gave out orders to the people: “When you see the Covenant-Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, carried by the Levitical priests, start moving. Follow it. Make sure you keep a proper distance between you and it, about half a mile—be sure now to keep your distance!—and you’ll see clearly the route to take. You’ve never been on this road before.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then Joshua addressed the people: “Sanctify yourselves. Tomorrow <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> will work miracle-wonders among you.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Joshua instructed the priests, “Take up the Chest of the Covenant and step out before the people.” So they took it up and processed before the people.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-8 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said to Joshua, “This very day I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel. They’ll see for themselves that I’m with you in the same way that I was with Moses. You will command the priests who are carrying the Chest of the Covenant: ‘When you come to the edge of the Jordan’s waters, stand there on the river bank.’”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-13 </sup>Then Joshua addressed the People of Israel: “Attention! Listen to what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, has to say. This is how you’ll know that God is alive among you—he will completely dispossess before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites. Look at what’s before you: the Chest of the Covenant. Think of it—the Master of the entire earth is crossing the Jordan as you watch. Now take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe. When the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, Master of all the earth, touch the Jordan’s water, the flow of water will be stopped—the water coming from upstream will pile up in a heap.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-16 </sup>And that’s what happened. The people left their tents to cross the Jordan, led by the priests carrying the Chest of the Covenant. When the priests got to the Jordan and their feet touched the water at the edge (the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest), the flow of water stopped. It piled up in a heap—a long way off—at Adam, which is near Zarethan. The river went dry all the way down to the Arabah Sea (the Salt Sea). And the people crossed, facing Jericho.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And there they stood; those priests carrying the Chest of the Covenant stood firmly planted on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground. Finally the whole nation was across the Jordan, and not one wet foot."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>When the whole nation was finally across, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> spoke to Joshua: “Select twelve men from the people, a man from each tribe, and tell them, ‘From right here, the middle of the Jordan where the feet of the priests are standing firm, take twelve stones. Carry them across with you and set them down in the place where you camp tonight.’”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-7 </sup>Joshua called out the twelve men whom he selected from the People of Israel, one man from each tribe. Joshua directed them, “Cross to the middle of the Jordan and take your place in front of the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God. Each of you heft a stone to your shoulder, a stone for each of the tribes of the People of Israel, so you’ll have something later to mark the occasion. When your children ask you, ‘What are these stones to you?’ you’ll say, ‘The flow of the Jordan was stopped in front of the Chest of the Covenant of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> as it crossed the Jordan—stopped in its tracks. These stones are a permanent memorial for the People of Israel.’”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>The People of Israel did exactly as Joshua commanded: They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan—a stone for each of the twelve tribes, just as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had instructed Joshua—carried them across with them to the camp, and set them down there. Joshua set up the twelve stones taken from the middle of the Jordan that had marked the place where the priests who carried the Chest of the Covenant had stood. They are still there today.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-11 </sup>The priests carrying the Chest continued standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything God had instructed Joshua to tell the people to do was done (confirming what Moses had instructed Joshua). The people crossed; no one dawdled. When the crossing of all the people was complete, they watched as the Chest of the Covenant and the priests crossed over.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had crossed over in battle formation in front of the People of Israel, obedient to Moses’ instructions. All told, about forty thousand armed soldiers crossed over before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> to the plains of Jericho, ready for battle.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> made Joshua great that day in the sight of all Israel. They were in awe of him just as they had been in awe of Moses all his life.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> told Joshua, “Command the priests carrying the Chest of The Testimony to come up from the Jordan.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>They did it. The priests carrying <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Chest of the Covenant came up from the middle of the Jordan. As soon as the soles of the priests’ feet touched dry land, the Jordan’s waters resumed their flow within the banks, just as before.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-22 </sup>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month. They set up camp at The Gilgal (The Circle) to the east of Jericho. Joshua erected a monument at The Gilgal, using the twelve stones that they had taken from the Jordan. And then he told the People of Israel, “In the days to come, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What are these stones doing here?’ tell your children this: ‘Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry ground.’",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-24 </sup>“Yes, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, dried up the Jordan’s waters for you until you had crossed, just as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, did at the Red Sea, which had dried up before us until we had crossed. This was so that everybody on earth would recognize how strong <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s rescuing hand is and so that you would hold <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> in solemn reverence always.”"
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>When all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and the Canaanite kings along the seacoast heard how <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had stopped the Jordan River before the People of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts sank; the courage drained out of them just thinking about the People of Israel.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>At that time <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said to Joshua, “Make stone knives and circumcise the People of Israel a second time.” So Joshua made stone knives and circumcised the People of Israel at Foreskins Hill.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-7 </sup>This is why Joshua conducted the circumcision. All the males who had left Egypt, the soldiers, had died in the wilderness on the journey out of Egypt. All the people who had come out of Egypt, of course, had been circumcised, but all those born in the wilderness along the way since leaving Egypt had not been. The fact is that the People of Israel had walked through that wilderness for forty years until the entire nation died out, all the men of military age who had come out of Egypt but had disobeyed the call of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> vowed that these would never lay eyes on the land <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had solemnly promised their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. But their children had replaced them. These are the ones Joshua circumcised. They had never been circumcised; no one had circumcised them along the way.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>When they had completed the circumcising of the whole nation, they stayed where they were in camp until they were healed.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt.” That’s why the place is called The Gilgal. It’s still called that.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The People of Israel continued to camp at The Gilgal. They celebrated the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the plains of Jericho.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>Right away, the day after the Passover, they started eating the produce of that country, unraised bread and roasted grain. And then no more manna; the manna stopped. As soon as they started eating food grown in the land, there was no more manna for the People of Israel. That year they ate from the crops of Canaan.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>And then this, while Joshua was there near Jericho: He looked up and saw right in front of him a man standing, holding his drawn sword. Joshua stepped up to him and said, “Whose side are you on—ours or our enemies’?”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>He said, “Neither. I’m commander of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s army. I’ve just arrived.” Joshua fell, face to the ground, and worshiped. He asked, “What orders does my Master have for his servant?”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s army commander ordered Joshua, “Take your sandals off your feet. The place you are standing is holy.”Joshua did it."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>Jericho was shut up tight as a drum because of the People of Israel: no one going in, no one coming out.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-5 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> spoke to Joshua, “Look sharp now. I’ve already given Jericho to you, along with its king and its crack troops. Here’s what you are to do: March around the city, all your soldiers. Circle the city once. Repeat this for six days. Have seven priests carry seven ram’s horn trumpets in front of the Chest. On the seventh day march around the city seven times, the priests blowing away on the trumpets. And then, a long blast on the ram’s horn—when you hear that, all the people are to shout at the top of their lungs. The city wall will collapse at once. All the people are to enter, every man straight on in.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and told them, “Take up the Chest of the Covenant. Seven priests are to carry seven ram’s horn trumpets leading <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Chest.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Then he told the people, “Set out! March around the city. Have the armed guard march before the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>And it happened. Joshua spoke, the people moved: Seven priests with their seven ram’s horn trumpets set out before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. They blew the trumpets, leading <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Chest of the Covenant. The armed guard marched ahead of the trumpet-blowing priests; the rear guard was marching after the Chest, marching and blowing their trumpets.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Joshua had given orders to the people, “Don’t shout. In fact, don’t even speak—not so much as a whisper until you hear me say, ‘Shout!’—then shout away!”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-13 </sup>He sent the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> on its way around the city. It circled once, came back to camp, and stayed for the night. Joshua was up early the next morning and the priests took up the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. The seven priests carrying the seven ram’s horn trumpets marched before the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, marching and blowing the trumpets, with the armed guard marching before and the rear guard marching after. Marching and blowing of trumpets!",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>On the second day they again circled the city once and returned to camp. They did this six days.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-17 </sup>When the seventh day came, they got up early and marched around the city this same way but seven times—yes, this day they circled the city seven times. On the seventh time around the priests blew the trumpets and Joshua signaled the people, “Shout!—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has given you the city! The city and everything in it is under a holy curse and offered up to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.“Except for Rahab the harlot—she is to live, she and everyone in her house with her, because she hid the agents we sent.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-19 </sup>“As for you, watch yourselves in the city under holy curse. Be careful that you don’t covet anything in it and take something that’s cursed, endangering the camp of Israel with the curse and making trouble for everyone. All silver and gold, all vessels of bronze and iron are holy to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Put them in <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s treasury.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The priests blew the trumpets.When the people heard the blast of the trumpets, they gave a thunderclap shout. The wall fell at once. The people rushed straight into the city and took it.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>They put everything in the city under the holy curse, killing man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-24 </sup>Joshua ordered the two men who had spied out the land, “Enter the house of the harlot and rescue the woman and everyone connected with her, just as you promised her.” So the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, and brothers—everyone connected with her. They got the whole family out and gave them a place outside the camp of Israel. But they burned down the city and everything in it, except for the gold and silver and the bronze and iron vessels—all that they put in the treasury of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s house.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>But Joshua let Rahab the harlot live—Rahab and her father’s household and everyone connected to her. She is still alive and well in Israel because she hid the agents whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Joshua swore a solemn oath at that time:Cursed before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is the manwho sets out to rebuild this city Jericho.He’ll pay for the foundation with his firstborn son,he’ll pay for the gates with his youngest son.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> was with Joshua. He became famous all over the land."
		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">7 </span>Then the People of Israel violated the holy curse. Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah, took some of the cursed things. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> became angry with the People of Israel.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai (The Ruin), which is near Beth Aven just east of Bethel. He instructed them, “Go up and spy out the land.” The men went up and spied out Ai.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>They returned to Joshua and reported, “Don’t bother sending a lot of people—two or three thousand men are enough to defeat Ai. Don’t wear out the whole army; there aren’t that many people there.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-5 </sup>So three thousand men went up—and then fled in defeat before the men of Ai! The men of Ai killed thirty-six—chased them from the city gate as far as The Quarries, killing them at the descent. The heart of the people sank, all spirit knocked out of them.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Joshua ripped his clothes and fell on his face to the ground before the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, he and the leaders throwing dirt on their heads, prostrate until evening.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-9 </sup>Joshua said, “Oh, oh, oh . . . Master, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Why did you insist on bringing this people across the Jordan? To make us victims of the Amorites? To wipe us out? Why didn’t we just settle down on the east side of the Jordan? Oh, Master, what can I say after this, after Israel has been run off by its enemies? When the Canaanites and all the others living here get wind of this, they’ll gang up on us and make short work of us—and then how will you keep up <i>your</i> reputation?”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-12 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said to Joshua, “Get up. Why are you groveling? Israel has sinned: They’ve broken the covenant I commanded them; they’ve taken forbidden plunder—stolen and then covered up the theft, squirreling it away with their own stuff. The People of Israel can no longer look their enemies in the eye—they themselves are plunder. I can’t continue with you if you don’t rid yourselves of the cursed things.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>“So get started. Purify the people. Tell them: Get ready for tomorrow by purifying yourselves. For this is what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the God of Israel, says: There are cursed things in the camp. You won’t be able to face your enemies until you have gotten rid of these cursed things.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>“First thing in the morning you will be called up by tribes. The tribe <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> names will come up clan by clan; the clan <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> names will come up family by family; and the family <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> names will come up man by man. The person found with the cursed things will be burned, he and everything he has, because he broke <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s covenant and did this despicable thing in Israel.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-18 </sup>Joshua was up at the crack of dawn and called Israel up tribe by tribe. The tribe of Judah was singled out. Then he called up the clans and singled out the Zerahites. He called up the Zerahite families and singled out the Zabdi family. He called up the family members one by one and singled out Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Joshua spoke to Achan, “My son, give glory to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the God of Israel. Make your confession to him. Tell me what you did. Don’t keep back anything from me.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>Achan answered Joshua, “It’s true. I sinned against <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the God of Israel. This is how I did it. In the plunder I spotted a beautiful Shinar robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a fifty-shekel bar of gold, and I coveted and took them. They are buried in my tent with the silver at the bottom.”",
