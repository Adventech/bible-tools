			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message as it came to Micah of Moresheth. It came during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. It had to do with what was going on in Samaria and Jerusalem.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Listen, people—all of you.Listen, earth, and everyone in it:The Master, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, takes the witness stand against you,the Master from his Holy Temple.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-5 </sup>Look, here he comes! <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, from his place!He comes down and strides across mountains and hills.Mountains sink under his feet,valleys split apart;The rock mountains crumble into gravel,the river valleys leak like sieves.All this because of Jacob’s sin,because Israel’s family did wrong.You ask, “So what is Jacob’s sin?”Just look at Samaria—isn’t it obvious?And all the sex-and-religion shrines in Judah—isn’t Jerusalem responsible?",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>“I’m turning Samaria into a heap of rubble,a vacant lot littered with garbage.I’ll dump the stones from her buildings in the valleyand leave her abandoned foundations exposed.All her carved and cast gods and goddesseswill be sold for stove wood and scrap metal,All her sacred fertility grovesburned to the ground,All the sticks and stones she worshiped as gods,destroyed.These were her earnings from her life as a whore.This is what happens to the fees of a whore.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>This is why I lament and mourn.This is why I go around in rags and barefoot.This is why I howl like a pack of coyotes,and moan like a mournful owl in the night.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has inflicted punishing wounds;Judah has been wounded with no healing in sight.Judgment has marched through the city gates.Jerusalem must face the charges.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-16 </sup>Don’t gossip about this in Telltown.Don’t waste your tears.In Dustville,roll in the dust.In Alarmtown,the alarm is sounded.The citizens of Exitburghwill never get out alive.Lament, Last-Stand City:There’s nothing in you left standing.The villagers of Bittertownwait in vain for sweet peace.Harsh judgment has come from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>and entered Peace City.All you who live in Chariotville,get in your chariots for flight.You led the daughter of Zioninto trusting not God but chariots.Similar sins in Israelalso got their start in you.Go ahead and give your good-bye giftsto Good-byeville.Miragetown beckonedbut disappointed Israel’s kings.Inheritance Cityhas lost its inheritance.Glorytownhas seen its last of glory.Shave your heads in mourningover the loss of your precious towns.Go bald as a goose egg—they’ve goneinto exile and aren’t coming back."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span><sup class=\"versenum mid-line\">1-5 </sup>Doom to those who plot evil,who go to bed dreaming up crimes!As soon as it’s morning,they’re off, full of energy, doing what they’ve planned.They covet fields and grab them,find homes and take them.They bully the neighbor and his family,see people only for what they can get out of them.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has had enough. He says,“I have some plans of my own:Disaster because of this interbreeding evil!Your necks are on the line.You’re not walking away from this.It’s doomsday for you.Mocking ballads will be sung of you,and you yourselves will sing the blues:‘Our lives are ruined,our homes and lands auctioned off.They take everything, leave us nothing!All is sold to the highest bidder.’”And there’ll be no one to stand up for you,no one to speak for you before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> and his jury.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>“Don’t preach,” say the preachers.“Don’t preach such stuff.Nothing bad will happen to us.Talk like <i>this</i> to the family of Jacob?Does <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> lose his temper?Is this the way he acts?Isn’t he on the side of good people?Doesn’t he help those who help themselves?”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-11 </sup>“What do you mean, ‘good people’!You’re the enemy of my people!You rob unsuspecting peopleout for an evening stroll.You take their coats off their backslike soldiers who plunder the defenseless.You drive the women of my peopleout of their ample homes.You make victims of the childrenand leave them vulnerable to violence and vice.Get out of here, the lot of you.You can’t take it easy here!You’ve polluted this place,and now <i>you’re</i> polluted—ruined!If someone showed up with a good smile and glib tongueand told lies from morning to night—‘I’ll preach sermons that will tell youhow you can get anything you want from God:More money, the best wines . . . you name it’—you’d hire him on the spot as your preacher!",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>“I’m calling a meeting, Jacob.I want everyone back—all the survivors of Israel.I’ll get them together in one place—like sheep in a fold, like cattle in a corral—a milling throng of homebound people!Then I, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, will burst all confinementsand lead them out into the open.They’ll follow their King.I will be out in front leading them.”"
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>Then I said:“Listen, leaders of Jacob, leaders of Israel:Don’t you know anything of justice?Haters of good, lovers of evil:Isn’t justice in your job description?But you skin my people alive.You rip the meat off their bones.You break up the bones, chop the meat,and throw it in a pot for cannibal stew.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>The time’s coming, though, when these same leaderswill cry out for help to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, but he won’t listen.He’ll turn his face the other waybecause of their history of evil.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-7 </sup>Here is <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Message to the prophets,the preachers who lie to my people:“For as long as they’re well paid and well fed,the prophets preach, ‘Isn’t life wonderful! Peace to all!’But if you don’t pay up and jump on their bandwagon,their ‘God bless you’ turns into ‘God damn you.’Therefore, you’re going blind. You’ll see nothing.You’ll live in deep shadows and know nothing.The sun has set on the prophets.They’ve had their day; from now on it’s night.Visionaries will be confused,experts will be all mixed up.They’ll hide behind their reputations and make lame excusesto cover up their God-ignorance.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But me—I’m filled with <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s power,filled with <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Spirit of justice and strength,Ready to confront Jacob’s crimeand Israel’s sin.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-12 </sup>The leaders of Jacob andthe leaders of Israel areLeaders contemptuous of justice,who twist and distort right living,Leaders who build Zion by killing people,who expand Jerusalem by committing crimes.Judges sell verdicts to the highest bidder,priests mass-market their teaching,prophets preach for high fees,All the while posturing and pretendingdependence on <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>:“We’ve got <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> on our side.He’ll protect us from disaster.”Because of people like you,Zion will be turned back into farmland,Jerusalem end up as a pile of rubble,and instead of the Temple on the mountain,a few scraggly scrub pines."

		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span><sup class=\"versenum mid-line\">1-4 </sup>But when all is said and done,<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Temple on the mountain,Firmly fixed, will dominate all mountains,towering above surrounding hills.People will stream to itand many nations set out for it,Saying, “Come, let’s climb <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s mountain.Let’s go to the Temple of Jacob’s God.He will teach us how to live.We’ll know how to live God’s way.”True teaching will issue from Zion,<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s revelation from Jerusalem.He’ll establish justice in the rabble of nationsand settle disputes in faraway places.They’ll trade in their swords for shovels,their spears for rakes and hoes.Nations will quit fighting each other,quit learning how to kill one another.Each man will sit under his own shade tree,each woman in safety will tend her own garden.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies says so,and he means what he says.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Meanwhile, all the other people live however they wish,picking and choosing their gods.But we live honoring <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>,and we’re loyal to our God forever and ever.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>“On that great day,” <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> says,“I will round up all the hurt and homeless,everyone I have bruised or banished.I will transform the battered into a company of the elite.I will make a strong nation out of the long lost,A showcase exhibit of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s rule in action,as I rule from Mount Zion, from here to eternity.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“And you stragglers around Jerusalem,eking out a living in shantytowns:The glory that once was will be again.Jerusalem’s daughter will be the kingdom center.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>So why the doomsday hysterics?You still have a king, don’t you?But maybe he’s not doing his joband you’re panicked like a woman in labor.Well, go ahead—twist and scream, Daughter Jerusalem.You <i>are</i> like a woman in childbirth.You’ll soon be out of the city, on your wayand camping in the open country.And then you’ll arrive in Babylon.What you lost in Jerusalem will be found in Babylon.<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> will give you new life again.He’ll redeem you from your enemies.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>But for right now, they’re ganged up against you,many godless peoples, saying,“Kick her when she’s down! Violate her!We want to see Zion grovel in the dirt.”These blasphemers have no ideawhat <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is thinking and doing in this.They don’t know that this is the making of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s people,that they are wheat being threshed, gold being refined.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>On your feet, Daughter of Zion! Be threshed of chaff,be refined of dross.I’m remaking you into a people invincible,into God’s juggernaut to crush the godless peoples.You’ll bring their plunder as holy offerings to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>,their wealth to the Master of the earth."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span>But for now, prepare for the worst, victim daughter!The siege is set against us.They humiliate Israel’s king,slapping him around like a rag doll.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-4 </sup>But you, Bethlehem, David’s country,the runt of the litter—From you will come the leaderwho will shepherd-rule Israel.He’ll be no upstart, no pretender.His family tree is ancient and distinguished.Meanwhile, Israel will be in foster homesuntil the birth pangs are over and the child is born,And the scattered brothers come backhome to the family of Israel.He will stand tall in his shepherd-rule by <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s strength,centered in the majesty of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-Revealed.And the people will have a good and safe home,for the whole world will hold him in respect—Peacemaker of the world!",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>And if some bullying Assyrian shows up,invades and violates our land, don’t worry.We’ll put him in his place, send him packing,and watch his every move.Shepherd-rule will extend as far as needed,to Assyria and all other Nimrod-bullies.Our shepherd-ruler will save us from old or new enemies,from anyone who invades or violates our land.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The purged and select company of Jacob will belike an island in the sea of peoples.They’ll be like dew from <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>,like summer showersNot mentioned in the weather forecast,not subject to calculation or control.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>Yes, the purged and select company of Jacob will belike an island in the sea of peoples,Like the king of beasts among wild beasts,like a young lion loose in a flock of sheep,Killing and devouring the lambsand no one able to stop him.With your arms raised in triumph over your foes,your enemies will be no more!",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-15 </sup>“The day is coming”—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Decree—“When there will be no more war. None.I’ll slaughter your war horses and demolish your chariots.I’ll dismantle military postsand level your fortifications.I’ll abolish your religious black markets,your underworld traffic in black magic.I will smash your carved and cast godsand chop down your phallic posts.No more taking control of the world,worshiping what you do or make.I’ll root out your sacred sex-and-power centersand destroy the God-defiant.In raging anger, I’ll make a clean sweepof godless nations who haven’t listened.”"

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-5 </sup>“Dear people, how have I done you wrong?Have I burdened you, worn you out? Answer!I delivered you from a bad life in Egypt;I paid a good price to get you out of slavery.I sent Moses to lead you—and Aaron and Miriam to boot!Remember what Balak king of Moab tried to pull,and how Balaam son of Beor turned the tables on him.Remember all those stories about Shittim and Gilgal.Keep all <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s salvation stories fresh and present.”",

			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But he’s already made it plain how to live, what to do,what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is looking for in men and women.It’s quite simple: Do what is fair and just to your neighbor,be compassionate and loyal in your love,And don’t take yourself too seriously—take God seriously.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Attention! <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> calls out to the city!If you know what’s good for you, you’ll listen.So listen, all of you!This is serious business.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-16 </sup>“Do you expect me to overlook obscene wealthyou’ve piled up by cheating and fraud?Do you think I’ll tolerate shady dealsand shifty scheming?I’m tired of the violent richbullying their way with bluffs and lies.I’m fed up. Beginning now, you’re finished.You’ll pay for your sins down to your last cent.No matter how much you get, it will never be enough—hollow stomachs, empty hearts.No matter how hard you work, you’ll have nothing to show for it—bankrupt lives, wasted souls.You’ll plant grassbut never get a lawn.You’ll make jellybut never spread it on your bread.You’ll press applesbut never drink the cider.You have lived by the standards of your king, Omri,the decadent lifestyle of the family of Ahab.Because you’ve slavishly followed their fashions,I’m forcing you into bankruptcy.Your way of life will be laughed at, a tasteless joke.Your lives will be derided as futile and fake.”"

He’s on my sideand is going to get me out of this.He’ll turn on the lights and show me his ways.I’ll see the whole picture and how right he is.And my enemy will see it, too,and be discredited—yes, disgraced!This enemy who kept taunting,“So where is this <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> of yours?”I’m going to see it with these, my own eyes—my enemy disgraced, trash in the gutter.",

A day for rebuilding your city,a day for stretching your arms, spreading your wings!All your dispersed and scattered people will come back,old friends and family from faraway places,From Assyria in the east to Egypt in the west,from across the seas and out of the mountains.But there’ll be a reversal for everyone else—massive depopulation—because of the way they lived, the things they did.",

			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-20 </sup>Where is the god who can compare with you—wiping the slate clean of guilt,Turning a blind eye, a deaf ear,to the past sins of your purged and precious people?You don’t nurse your anger and don’t stay angry long,for mercy is your specialty. That’s what you love most.And compassion is on its way to us.You’ll stamp out our wrongdoing.You’ll sink our sinsto the bottom of the ocean.You’ll stay true to your word to Father Jacoband continue the compassion you showed Grandfather Abraham—Everything you promised our ancestorsfrom a long time ago."
