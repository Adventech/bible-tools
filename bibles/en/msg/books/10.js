			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Shortly after Saul died, David returned to Ziklag from his rout of the Amalekites. Three days later a man showed up unannounced from Saul’s army camp.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>Disheveled and obviously in mourning, he fell to his knees in respect before David. David asked, “What brings you here?”He answered, “I’ve just escaped from the camp of Israel.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>“So what happened?” said David. “What’s the news?”He said, “The Israelites have fled the battlefield, leaving a lot of their dead comrades behind. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>David pressed the young soldier for details: “How do you know for sure that Saul and Jonathan are dead?”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-8 </sup>“I just happened by Mount Gilboa and came on Saul, badly wounded and leaning on his spear, with enemy chariots and horsemen bearing down hard on him. He looked behind him, saw me, and called me to him. ‘Yes sir,’ I said, ‘at your service.’ He asked me who I was, and I told him, ‘I’m an Amalekite.’”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>“Come here,” he said, “and put me out of my misery. I’m nearly dead already, but my life hangs on.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“So I did what he asked—I killed him. I knew he wouldn’t last much longer anyway. I removed his royal headband and bracelet, and have brought them to my master. Here they are.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>In lament, David ripped his clothes to ribbons. All the men with him did the same. They wept and fasted the rest of the day, grieving the death of Saul and his son Jonathan, and also the army of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> and the nation Israel, victims in a failed battle.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then David spoke to the young soldier who had brought the report: “Who are you, anyway?”“I’m from an immigrant family—an Amalekite.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>“Do you mean to say,” said David, “that you weren’t afraid to up and kill <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s anointed king?” Right then he ordered one of his soldiers, “Strike him dead!” The soldier struck him, and he died.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>“You asked for it,” David told him. “You sealed your death sentence when you said you killed <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s anointed king.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-18 </sup>Then David sang this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan, and gave orders that everyone in Judah learn it by heart. Yes, it’s even inscribed in The Book of Jashar.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-21 </sup>Oh, oh, Gazelles of Israel, struck down on your hills,the mighty warriors—fallen, fallen!Don’t announce it in the city of Gath,don’t post the news in the streets of Ashkelon.Don’t give those coarse Philistine girlsone more excuse for a drunken party!No more dew or rain for you, hills of Gilboa,and not a drop from springs and wells,For there the warriors’ shields were dragged through the mud,Saul’s shield left there to rot.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Jonathan’s bow was bold—the bigger they were the harder they fell.Saul’s sword was fearless—once out of the scabbard, nothing could stop it.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Saul and Jonathan—beloved, beautiful!Together in life, together in death.Swifter than plummeting eagles,stronger than proud lions.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>Women of Israel, weep for Saul.He dressed you in finest cottons and silks,spared no expense in making you elegant.The mighty warriors—fallen, fallenin the middle of the fight!Jonathan—struck down on your hills!",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>O my dear brother Jonathan,I’m crushed by your death.Your friendship was a miracle-wonder,love far exceeding anything I’ve known—or ever hope to know.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>The mighty warriors—fallen, fallen.And the arms of war broken to bits."
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>After all this, David prayed. He asked <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, “Shall I move to one of the cities of Judah?”<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said, “Yes, move.”“And to which city?”“To Hebron.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>So David moved to Hebron, along with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. David’s men, along with their families, also went with him and made their home in and around Hebron.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-7 </sup>The citizens of Judah came to Hebron, and then and there made David king over the clans of Judah.A report was brought to David that the men of Jabesh Gilead had given Saul a decent burial. David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead: “<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> bless you for this—for honoring your master, Saul, with a funeral. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> honor you and be true to you—and I’ll do the same, matching your generous act of goodness. Strengthen your resolve and do what must be done. Your master, Saul, is dead. The citizens of Judah have made me their king.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-11 </sup>In the meantime, Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Saul’s son Ish-Bosheth to Mahanaim and made him king over Gilead, over Asher, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin—king, as it turns out, over all Israel. Ish-Bosheth Saul’s son, was forty years old when he was made king over Israel. He lasted only two years. But the people of Judah stuck with David. David ruled the people of Judah from Hebron for seven and a half years.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-13 </sup>One day Abner son of Ner set out from Mahanaim with the soldiers of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, headed for Gibeon. Joab son of Zeruiah, with David’s soldiers, also set out. They met at the Pool of Gibeon, Abner’s group on one side, Joab’s on the other.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Abner challenged Joab, “Put up your best fighters. Let’s see them do their stuff.”Joab said, “Good! Let them go at it!”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>So they lined up for the fight, twelve Benjaminites from the side of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve soldiers from David’s side. The men from each side grabbed their opponents’ heads and stabbed them with their daggers. They all fell dead—the whole bunch together. So, they called the place Slaughter Park. It’s right there at Gibeon.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-19 </sup>The fighting went from bad to worse throughout the day. Abner and the men of Israel were beaten to a pulp by David’s men. The three sons of Zeruiah were present: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel, as fast as a wild antelope on the open plain, chased Abner, staying hard on his heels.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Abner turned and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”“It surely is,” he said.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Abner said, “Let up on me. Pick on someone you have a chance of beating and be content with those spoils!” But Asahel wouldn’t let up.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Abner tried again, “Turn back. Don’t force me to kill you. How would I face your brother Joab?”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-25 </sup>When he refused to quit, Abner struck him in the belly with the blunt end of his spear so hard that it came out his back. Asahel fell to the ground and died at once. Everyone who arrived at the spot where Asahel fell and died stood and gaped—Asahel dead! But Joab and Abishai kept up the chase after Abner. As the sun began to set, they came to the hill of Ammah that faced Giah on the road to the backcountry of Gibeon. The Benjaminites had taken their stand with Abner there, deployed strategically on a hill.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Abner called out to Joab, “Are we going to keep killing each other till doomsday? Don’t you know that nothing but bitterness will come from this? How long before you call off your men from chasing their brothers?”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27-28 </sup>“As God lives,” said Joab, “if you hadn’t spoken up, we’d have kept up the chase until morning!” Then he blew the ram’s horn trumpet and the whole army of Judah stopped in its tracks. They quit chasing Israel and called off the fighting.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Abner and his soldiers marched all that night up the Arabah Valley. They crossed the Jordan and, after a long morning’s march, arrived at Mahanaim.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30-32 </sup>After Joab returned from chasing Abner, he took a head count of the army. Nineteen of David’s men (besides Asahel) were missing. David’s men had cut down 360 of Abner’s men, all Benjaminites—all dead. They brought Asahel and buried him in the family tomb in Bethlehem. Joab and his men then marched all night, arriving in Hebron as the dawn broke."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>The war between the house of Saul and the house of David dragged on and on. The longer it went on the stronger David became, with the house of Saul getting weaker.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-5 </sup>During the Hebron years, sons were born to David:Amnon, born of Ahinoam of Jezreel—the firstborn;Kileab, born of Abigail of Carmel, Nabal’s widow—his second;Absalom, born of Maacah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur—the third;Adonijah, born of Haggith—the fourth;Shephatiah, born of Abital—the fifth;Ithream, born of Eglah—the sixth.These six sons of David were born in Hebron.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6-7 </sup>Abner took advantage of the continuing war between the house of Saul and the house of David to gain power for himself. Saul had had a concubine, Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. One day Ish-Bosheth confronted Abner: “What business do you have sleeping with my father’s concubine?”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-10 </sup>Abner lost his temper with Ish-Bosheth, “Treat me like a dog, will you! Is this the thanks I get for sticking by the house of your father, Saul, and all his family and friends? I personally saved you from certain capture by David, and you make an issue out of my going to bed with a woman! What <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> promised David, I’ll help accomplish—transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and make David ruler over the whole country, both Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba. If not, may God do his worst to me.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Ish-Bosheth, cowed by Abner’s outburst, couldn’t say another word.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Abner went ahead and sent personal messengers to David: “Make a deal with me and I’ll help bring the whole country of Israel over to you.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>“Great,” said David. “It’s a deal. But only on one condition: You’re not welcome here unless you bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, with you when you come to meet me.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>David then sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul: “Give me back Michal, whom I won as my wife at the cost of a hundred Philistine foreskins.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>Ish-Bosheth ordered that she be taken from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. But Paltiel followed her, weeping all the way, to Bahurim. There Abner told him, “Go home.” And he went home.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-18 </sup>Abner got the elders of Israel together and said, “Only yesterday, it seems, you were looking for a way to make David your king. So do it—now! For <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has given the go-ahead on David: ‘By my servant David’s hand, I’ll save my people Israel from the oppression of the Philistines and all their other enemies.’”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Abner took the Benjaminites aside and spoke to them. Then he went to Hebron for a private talk with David, telling him everything that Israel in general and Benjamin in particular were planning to do.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>When Abner and the twenty men who were with him met with David in Hebron, David laid out a feast for them.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Abner then said, “I’m ready. Let me go now to rally everyone in Israel for my master, the king. They’ll make a treaty with you, authorizing you to rule them however you see fit.” Abner was sent off with David’s blessing.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>Soon after that, David’s men, led by Joab, came back from a field assignment. Abner was no longer in Hebron with David, having just been dismissed with David’s blessing. As Joab and his raiding party arrived, they were told that Abner the son of Ner had been there with David and had been sent off with David’s blessing.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>Joab went straight to the king: “What’s this you’ve done? Abner shows up, and you let him walk away scot-free? You know Abner son of Ner better than that. This was no friendly visit. He was here to spy on you, figure out your comings and goings, find out what you’re up to.”",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26-27 </sup>Joab left David and went into action. He sent messengers after Abner; they caught up with him at the well at Sirah and brought him back. David knew nothing of all this. When Abner got back to Hebron, Joab steered him aside at the gate for a personal word with him. There he stabbed him in the belly, killed him in cold blood for the murder of his brother Asahel.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28-30 </sup>Later on, when David heard what happened, he said, “Before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> I and my kingdom are totally innocent of this murder of Abner son of Ner. Joab and his entire family will always be under the curse of this bloodguilt. May they forever be victims of crippling diseases, violence, and famine.” (Joab and his brother, Abishai, murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel at the battle of Gibeon.)",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31-32 </sup>David ordered Joab and all the men under him, “Rip your cloaks into rags! Wear mourning clothes! Lead Abner’s funeral procession with loud lament!” King David followed the coffin. They buried Abner in Hebron. The king’s voice was loud in lament as he wept at the side of Abner’s grave. All the people wept, too.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33-34 </sup>Then the king sang this tribute to Abner:Can this be? Abner dead like a nameless bum?You were a free man, free to go and do as you wished—Yet you fell as a victim in a street brawl.And all the people wept—a crescendo of crying!",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35-37 </sup>They all came then to David, trying to get him to eat something before dark. But David solemnly swore, “I’ll not so much as taste a piece of bread, or anything else for that matter, before sunset, so help me God!” Everyone at the funeral took notice—and liked what they saw. In fact everything the king did was applauded by the people. It was clear to everyone that day, including all Israel, that the king had nothing to do with the death of Abner son of Ner.",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38-39 </sup>The king spoke to his servants: “You realize, don’t you, that today a prince and hero fell victim of foul play in Israel? And I, though anointed king, was helpless to do anything about it. These sons of Zeruiah are too much for me. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, requite the criminal for his crime!”"
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>Saul’s son, Ish-Bosheth, heard that Abner had died in Hebron. His heart sank. The whole country was shaken.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>Ish-Bosheth had two men who were captains of raiding bands—one was named Baanah, the other Recab. They were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, a Benjaminite. (The people of Beeroth had been assigned to Benjamin ever since they escaped to Gittaim. They still live there as resident aliens.)",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>It so happened that Saul’s son, Jonathan, had a son who was maimed in both feet. When he was five years old, the report on Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and ran, but in her hurry to get away she fell, and the boy was maimed. His name was Mephibosheth.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-7 </sup>One day Baanah and Recab, the two sons of Rimmon, headed out for the house of Ish-Bosheth. They arrived at the hottest time of the day, just as he was taking his afternoon nap. They entered the house on a ruse, pretending official business. The maid guarding the bedroom had fallen asleep, so Recab and Baanah slipped by her and entered the room where Ish-Bosheth was asleep on his bed. They killed him and then cut off his head, carrying it off as a trophy. They traveled all night long, taking the route through the Arabah Valley.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>They presented the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron, telling the king, “Here’s the head of Ish-Bosheth, Saul’s son, your enemy. He was out to kill you, but <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has given vengeance to my master, the king—vengeance this very day on Saul and his children!”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-11 </sup>David answered the brothers Recab and Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> lives—the One who got me out of every trouble I’ve ever been in—when the messenger told me, ‘Good news! Saul is dead!’ supposing I’d be delighted, I arrested him and killed him on the spot in Ziklag. That’s what he got for his so-called good news! And now you show up—evil men who killed an innocent man in cold blood, a man asleep in his own house! Don’t think I won’t find you guilty of murder and rid the country of you!”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>David then issued orders to his soldiers. They killed the two—chopped off their hands and feet, and hung the corpses at the pool in Hebron. But Ish-Bosheth’s head they took and buried in Abner’s tomb in Hebron."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Before long all the tribes of Israel approached David in Hebron and said, “Look at us—your own flesh and blood! In time past when Saul was our king, you were the one who really ran the country. Even then <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel and you’ll be the prince.’”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>All the leaders of Israel met with King David at Hebron, and the king made a treaty with them in the presence of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. And so they anointed David king over Israel.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-5 </sup>David was thirty years old when he became king, and ruled for forty years. In Hebron he ruled Judah for seven and a half years. In Jerusalem he ruled all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>David and his men immediately set out for Jerusalem to take on the Jebusites, who lived in that country. But they said, “You might as well go home! Even the blind and the lame could keep you out. You can’t get in here!” They had convinced themselves that David couldn’t break through.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-8 </sup>But David went right ahead and captured the fortress of Zion, known ever since as the City of David. That day David said, “To get the best of these Jebusites, one must target the water system, not to mention this so-called lame and blind bunch that David hates.” (In fact, he was so sick and tired of it, people coined the expression, “No lame and blind allowed in the palace.”)",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>David made the fortress city his home and named it “City of David.” He developed the city from the outside terraces inward. David proceeded with a longer stride, a larger embrace since the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies was with him.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>It was at this time that Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with timbers of cedar. He also sent carpenters and masons to build a house for David. David took this as a sign that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had confirmed him as king of Israel, giving his kingship world prominence for the sake of Israel, his people.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-16 </sup>David took on more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he left Hebron. And more sons and daughters were born to him. These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem:Shammua,Shobab,Nathan,Solomon,Ibhar,Elishua,Nepheg,Japhia,Elishama,Eliada,Eliphelet.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-18 </sup>When the Philistines got word that David had been made king over all Israel, they came on the hunt for him. David heard of it and went down to the stronghold. When the Philistines arrived, they deployed their forces in Raphaim Valley.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Then David prayed to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>: “Shall I go up and fight the Philistines? Will you help me beat them?”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>“Go up,” <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> replied. “Count on me. I’ll help you beat them.”David then went straight to Baal Perazim, and smashed them to pieces. Afterward David said, “<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> exploded on my enemies like a gush of water.” That’s why David named the place Baal Perazim (The-Master-Who-Explodes). The retreating Philistines dumped their idols, and David and his soldiers took them away.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>Later there was a repeat performance. The Philistines came up again and deployed their troops in the Rephaim Valley. David again prayed to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-24 </sup>This time <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> said, “Don’t attack them head-on. Instead, circle around behind them and ambush them from the grove of sacred trees. When you hear the sound of shuffling in the trees, get ready to move out. It’s a signal that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is going ahead of you to smash the Philistine camp.”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>David did exactly what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> told him. He routed the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer."
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>David mustered the pick of the troops of Israel—thirty divisions of them. Together with his soldiers, David headed for Baalah to recover the Chest of God, which was called by the Name <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies, who was enthroned over the pair of angels on the Chest.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-7 </sup>They placed the Chest of God on a brand-new oxcart and removed it from Abinadab’s house on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab’s sons, were driving the new cart loaded with the Chest of God, Ahio in the lead and Uzzah alongside the Chest. David and the whole company of Israel were in the parade, singing at the top of their lungs and playing mandolins, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals. When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, so Uzzah reached out and grabbed the Chest of God. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> blazed in anger against Uzzah and struck him hard because he had profaned the Chest. Uzzah died on the spot, right alongside the Chest.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-11 </sup>Then David got angry because of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s deadly outburst against Uzzah. That place is still called Perez Uzzah (The-Explosion-Against-Uzzah). David became fearful of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> that day and said, “This Chest is too hot to handle. How can I ever get it back to the City of David?” He refused to take the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> a step farther. Instead, David removed it off the road and to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. The Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> stayed at the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months. And <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> prospered Obed-Edom and his entire household.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-16 </sup>It was reported to King David that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had prospered Obed-Edom and his entire household because of the Chest of God. So David thought, “I’ll get that blessing for myself,” and went and brought up the Chest of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David, celebrating extravagantly all the way, with frequent sacrifices of choice bulls. David, ceremonially dressed in priest’s linen, danced with great abandon before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. The whole country was with him as he accompanied the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> with shouts and trumpet blasts. But as the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> came into the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, happened to be looking out a window. When she saw King David leaping and dancing before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, her heart filled with scorn.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-19 </sup>They brought the Chest of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> and set it in the middle of the tent pavilion that David had pitched for it. Then and there David worshiped, offering burnt offerings and peace offerings. When David had completed the sacrifices of burnt and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies and handed out to each person in the crowd, men and women alike, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. Then everyone went home.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-22 </sup>David returned home to bless his family. Michal, Saul’s daughter, came out to greet him: “How wonderfully the king has distinguished himself today—exposing himself to the eyes of the servants’ maids like some burlesque street dancer!” David replied to Michal, “In <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s presence I’ll dance all I want! He chose me over your father and the rest of our family and made me prince over <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s people, over Israel. Oh yes, I’ll dance to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s glory—more recklessly even than this. And as far as I’m concerned . . . I’ll gladly look like a fool . . . but among these maids you’re so worried about, I’ll be honored no end.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Michal, Saul’s daughter, was barren the rest of her life."
		},
		"7": {

			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king. Then he instructed his servants, “Look sharp, now. When Amnon is well into the sauce and feeling no pain, and I give the order ‘Strike Amnon,’ kill him. And don’t be afraid—I’m the one giving the command. Courage! You can do it!”",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29-31 </sup>Absalom’s servants did to Amnon exactly what their master ordered. All the king’s sons got out as fast as they could, jumped on their mules, and rode off. While they were still on the road, a rumor came to the king: “Absalom just killed all the king’s sons—not one is left!” The king stood up, ripped his clothes to shreds, and threw himself on the floor. All his servants who were standing around at the time did the same.",

Only Amnon is dead. This happened because of Absalom’s outrage since the day that Amnon violated his sister Tamar. So my master, the king, mustn’t make things worse than they are, thinking that all your sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.”",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Absalom fled.Just then the sentry on duty looked up and saw a cloud of dust on the road from Horonaim alongside the mountain. He came and told the king, “I’ve just seen a bunch of men on the Horonaim road, coming around the mountain.”",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35-37 </sup>Then Jonadab exclaimed to the king, “See! It’s the king’s sons coming, just as I said!” He had no sooner said the words than the king’s sons burst in—loud laments and weeping! The king joined in, along with all the servants—loud weeping, many tears. David mourned the death of his son a long time.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37-39 </sup>When Absalom fled, he went to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. He was there three years. The king finally gave up trying to get back at Absalom. He had come to terms with Amnon’s death."

Then go to the king and tell him this . . .” Joab then told her exactly what to say.",

The two of them got into a fight out in the field and there was no one around to step between them. The one struck the other and killed him. Then the whole family ganged up against me and demanded, ‘Hand over this murderer so we can kill him for the life of the brother he murdered!’ They want to wipe out the heir and snuff out the one spark of life left to me. And then there would be nothing left of my husband—not so much as a name—on the face of the earth.",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Then she asked, “May I say one more thing to my master, the king?”He said, “Go ahead.”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>“Why, then,” the woman said, “have you done this very thing against God’s people?

He works out ways to get the exile back.”",

When the king hears what’s going on, he’ll step in and rescue me from the abuse of the man who would get rid of me and my son and God’s inheritance—the works!’ As your handmaid, I decided ahead of time, ‘The word of my master, the king, will be the last word in this, for my master is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil.’ <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> be with you!”",

Yes, it was your servant Joab who put me up to this, and put these very words in my mouth. It was because he wanted to turn things around that your servant Joab did this. But my master is as wise as God’s angels in knowing how to handle things on this earth.”",

			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-27 </sup>This Absalom! There wasn’t a man in all Israel talked about so much for his handsome good looks—and not a blemish on him from head to toe! When he cut his hair—he always cut it short in the spring because it had grown so heavy—the weight of the hair from his head was over two pounds! Three sons were born to Absalom, and one daughter. Her name was Tamar—and she was a beauty.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28-31 </sup>Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years, and not once did he see the king face-to-face. He sent for Joab to get him in to see the king, but Joab still wouldn’t budge. He tried a second time and Joab still wouldn’t. So he told his servants, “Listen. Joab’s field adjoins mine, and he has a crop of barley in it. Go set fire to it.” So Absalom’s servants set fire to the field. That got him moving—Joab came to Absalom at home and said, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”",

I want to send you to the king to ask, “What’s the point of my coming back from Geshur? I’d be better off still there!” Let me see the king face-to-face. If he finds me guilty, then he can put me to death.’”",

Anybody with a case could bring it to me and I’d settle things fair and square.” Whenever someone would treat him with special honor, he’d shrug it off and treat him like an equal, making him feel important. Absalom did this to everyone who came to do business with the king and stole the hearts of everyone in Israel.",

But they had been called together knowing nothing of the plot and made the trip innocently. While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he managed also to involve Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s advisor, calling him away from his hometown of Giloh. The conspiracy grew powerful and Absalom’s supporters multiplied.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Someone came to David with the report, “The whole country has taken up with Absalom!”",

Go back, and take your family with you. And God’s grace and truth go with you!”",

As the king crossed the Brook Kidron, the army headed for the road to the wilderness. Zadok was also there, the Levites with him, carrying <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Chest of the Covenant. They set the Chest of God down, Abiathar standing by, until all the people had evacuated the city.",

			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>David was told, “Ahithophel has joined the conspirators with Absalom.” He prayed, “Oh, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>—turn Ahithophel’s counsel to foolishness.”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32-36 </sup>As David approached the top of the hill where God was worshiped, Hushai the Arkite, clothes ripped to shreds and dirt on his head, was there waiting for him. David said, “If you come with me, you’ll be just one more piece of luggage. Go back to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I’m ready to be your servant, O King; I used to be your father’s servant, now I’m your servant.’ Do that and you’ll be able to confuse Ahithophel’s counsel for me. The priests Zadok and Abiathar are already there; whatever information you pick up in the palace, tell them. Their two sons—Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan—are there with them—anything you pick up can be sent to me by them.”",

To the accompaniment of curses he shouted, “Get lost, get lost, you butcher, you hellhound! <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has paid you back for all your dirty work in the family of Saul and for stealing his kingdom. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has given the kingdom to your son Absalom.

Even while we’re talking, he’s probably holed up in some cave or other. If he jumps your men from ambush, word will soon get back, ‘A slaughter of Absalom’s army!’ Even if your men are valiant with hearts of lions, they’ll fall apart at such news, for everyone in Israel knows the kind of fighting stuff your father’s made of, and also the men with him.",

The wife took a rug and covered the well, then spread grain on it so no one would notice anything out of the ordinary. Shortly, Absalom’s servants came to the woman’s house and asked her, “Have you seen Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”The woman said, “They were headed toward the river.”They looked but didn’t find them, and then went back to Jerusalem.",

They took Absalom, dumped him into a huge pit in the forest, and piled an immense mound of rocks over him.Meanwhile the whole army of Israel was in flight, each man making his own way home.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>While alive, Absalom had erected for himself a pillar in the Valley of the King, “because,” he said, “I have no son to carry on my name.” He inscribed the pillar with his own name. To this day it is called “The Absalom Memorial.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-20 </sup>Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, said, “Let me run to the king and bring him the good news that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has delivered him from his enemies.” But Joab said, “You’re not the one to deliver the good news today; some other day, maybe, but it’s not ‘good news’ today.” (This was because the king’s son was dead.)",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Then Joab ordered a Cushite, “You go. Tell the king what you’ve seen.”“Yes sir,” said the Cushite, and ran off.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Ahimaaz son of Zadok kept at it, begging Joab, “What does it matter? Let me run, too, following the Cushite.”Joab said, “Why all this ‘Run, run’? You’ll get no thanks for it, I can tell you.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>“I don’t care; let me run.”“Okay,” said Joab, “run.” So Ahimaaz ran, taking the lower valley road, and passed the Cushite.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>David was sitting between the two gates. The sentry had gone up to the top of the gate on the wall and looked around. He saw a solitary runner. The sentry called down and told the king. The king said, “If he’s alone, it must be good news!”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-26 </sup>As the runner came closer, the sentry saw another runner and called down to the gate, “Another runner all by himself.”And the king said, “This also must be good news.”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then the sentry said, “I can see the first man now; he runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.”“He’s a good man,” said the king. “He’s bringing good news for sure.”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Then Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “Peace!” Then he bowed deeply before the king, his face to the ground. “Blessed be your <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>; he has handed over the men who rebelled against my master the king.”",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>The king asked, “But is the young man Absalom all right?”Ahimaaz said, “I saw a huge ruckus just as Joab was sending me off, but I don’t know what it was about.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>The king said, “Step aside and stand over there.” So he stepped aside.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Then the Cushite arrived and said, “Good news, my master and king! <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has given victory today over all those who rebelled against you!”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>“But,” said the king, “is the young man Absalom all right?”And the Cushite replied, “Would that all of the enemies of my master the king and all who maliciously rose against you end up like that young man.”",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>The king was stunned. Heartbroken, he went up to the room over the gate and wept. As he wept he cried out,O my son Absalom, my dear, dear son Absalom!Why not me rather than you, my death and not yours,O Absalom, my dear, dear son!"
		},
		"19": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">19 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-4 </sup>Joab was told that David was weeping and lamenting over Absalom. The day’s victory turned into a day of mourning as word passed through the army, “David is grieving over his son.” The army straggled back to the city that day demoralized, dragging their tails. And the king held his face in his hands and lamented loudly,O my son Absalom,Absalom my dear, dear son!",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-7 </sup>But in private Joab rebuked the king: “Now you’ve done it—knocked the wind out of your loyal servants who have just saved your life, to say nothing of the lives of your sons and daughters, wives and concubines. What is this—loving those who hate you and hating those who love you? Your actions give a clear message: officers and soldiers mean nothing to you. You know that if Absalom were alive right now, we’d all be dead—would that make you happy? Get hold of yourself; get out there and put some heart into your servants! I swear to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> that if you don’t go to them they’ll desert; not a soldier will be left here by nightfall. And that will be the worst thing that has happened yet.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>So the king came out and took his place at the city gate. Soon everyone knew: “Oh, look! The king has come out to receive us.” And his whole army came and presented itself to the king. But the Israelites had fled the field of battle and gone home.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>Meanwhile, the whole populace was now complaining to its leaders, “Wasn’t it the king who saved us time and again from our enemies, and rescued us from the Philistines? And now he has had to flee the country on account of Absalom. And now this Absalom whom we made king is dead in battle. So what are you waiting for? Why don’t you bring the king back?”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-13 </sup>When David heard what was being said, he sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, “Ask the elders of Judah, ‘Why are you so laggard in bringing the king back home? You’re my brothers! You’re my own flesh and blood! So why are you the last ones to bring the king back home?’ And tell Amasa, ‘You, too, are my flesh and blood. As God is my witness, I’m making you the permanent commander of the army in place of Joab.’”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>He captured the hearts of everyone in Judah. They were unanimous in sending for the king: “Come back, you and all your servants.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-18 </sup>So the king returned. He arrived at the Jordan just as Judah reached Gilgal on their way to welcome the king and escort him across the Jordan. Even Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, hurried down to join the men of Judah so he could welcome the king, a thousand Benjaminites with him. And Ziba, Saul’s steward, with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, waded across the Jordan to meet the king and brought his entourage across, doing whatever they could to make the king comfortable.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-20 </sup>Shimei son of Gera bowed deeply in homage to the king as soon as he was across the Jordan and said, “Don’t think badly of me, my master! Overlook my irresponsible outburst on the day my master the king left Jerusalem—don’t hold it against me! I know I sinned, but look at me now—the first of all the tribe of Joseph to come down and welcome back my master the king!”",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Abishai son of Zeruiah interrupted, “Enough of this! Shouldn’t we kill him outright? Why, he cursed <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s anointed!”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But David said, “What is it with you sons of Zeruiah? Why do you insist on being so contentious? Nobody is going to be killed today. I am again king over Israel!”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Then the king turned to Shimei, “You’re not going to die.” And the king gave him his word.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>Next Mephibosheth grandson of Saul arrived from Jerusalem to welcome the king. He hadn’t combed his hair or trimmed his beard or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safe and sound. The king said, “And why didn’t you come with me, Mephibosheth?”",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26-28 </sup>“My master the king,” he said, “my servant betrayed me. I told him to saddle my donkey so I could ride it and go with the king, for, as you know, I am lame. And then he lied to you about me. But my master the king has been like one of God’s angels: he knew what was right and did it. Wasn’t everyone in my father’s house doomed? But you took me in and gave me a place at your table. What more could I ever expect or ask?”",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>“That’s enough,” said the king. “Say no more. Here’s my decision: You and Ziba divide the property between you.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>Mephibosheth said, “Oh, let him have it all! All I care about is that my master the king is home safe and sound!”",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31-32 </sup>Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim. He crossed the Jordan with the king to give him a good send-off. Barzillai was a very old man—eighty years old! He had supplied the king’s needs all the while he was in Mahanaim since he was very wealthy.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>“Join me in Jerusalem,” the king said to Barzillai. “Let me take care of you.”",
			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34-37 </sup>But Barzillai declined the offer, “How long do you think I’d live if I went with the king to Jerusalem? I’m eighty years old and not much good anymore to anyone. Can’t taste food; can’t hear music. So why add to the burdens of my master the king? I’ll just go a little way across the Jordan with the king. But why would the king need to make a great thing of that? Let me go back and die in my hometown and be buried with my father and mother. But my servant Kimham here; let him go with you in my place. But treat him well!”",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>The king said, “That’s settled; Kimham goes with me. And I will treat him well! If you think of anything else, I’ll do that for you, too.”",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39-40 </sup>The army crossed the Jordan but the king stayed. The king kissed and blessed Barzillai, who then returned home. Then the king, Kimham with him, crossed over at Gilgal.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40-41 </sup>The whole army of Judah and half the army of Israel processed with the king. The men of Israel came to the king and said, “Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, taken over as if they owned the king, escorting the king and his family and close associates across the Jordan?”",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>The men of Judah retorted, “Because the king is related to us, that’s why! But why make a scene? You don’t see us getting treated special because of it, do you?”",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>The men of Israel shot back, “We have ten shares in the king to your one. Besides we’re the firstborn—so why are we having to play second fiddle? It was our idea to bring him back.”But the men of Judah took a harder line than the men of Israel."
		},
		"20": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">20 </span>Just then a good-for-nothing named Sheba son of Bicri the Benjaminite blew a blast on the ram’s horn trumpet, calling out,We’ve got nothing to do with David,there’s no future for us with the son of Jesse!Let’s get out of here, Israel—head for your tents!",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-3 </sup>So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed committed, sticking with their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem. When David arrived home in Jerusalem, the king took the ten concubines he had left to watch the palace and placed them in seclusion, under guard. He provided for their needs but didn’t visit them. They were virtual prisoners until they died, widows as long as they lived.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-10 </sup>The king ordered Amasa, “Muster the men of Judah for me in three days; then report in.” Amasa went to carry out his orders, but he was late reporting back. So David told Abishai, “Sheba son of Bicri is going to hurt us even worse than Absalom did. Take your master’s servants and hunt him down before he gets holed up in some fortress city where we can’t get to him.” So under Abishai’s command, all the best men—Joab’s men and the Kerethites and Pelethites—left Jerusalem to hunt down Sheba son of Bicri. They were near the boulder at Gibeon when Amasa came their way. Joab was wearing a tunic with a sheathed sword strapped on his waist, but the sword slipped out and fell to the ground. Joab greeted Amasa, “How are you, brother?” and took Amasa’s beard in his right hand as if to kiss him. Amasa didn’t notice the sword in Joab’s other hand. Joab stuck him in the belly and his guts spilled to the ground. A second blow wasn’t needed; he was dead. Then Joab and his brother Abishai continued to chase Sheba son of Bicri.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-14 </sup>One of Joab’s soldiers took up his post over the body and called out, “Everyone who sides with Joab and supports David, follow Joab!” Amasa was lying in a pool of blood in the middle of the road; the man realized that the whole army was going to stop and take a look, so he pulled Amasa’s corpse off the road into the field and threw a blanket over him so it wouldn’t collect spectators. As soon as he’d gotten him off the road, the traffic flowed normally, following Joab in the chase after Sheba son of Bicri. Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel as far as Abel Beth Maacah; all the Bicrites clustered and followed him into the city.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Joab’s army arrived and laid siege to Sheba in Abel Beth Maacah. They built a siege-ramp up against the city’s fortification. The plan was to knock down the wall.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-17 </sup>But a shrewd woman called out from the city, “Listen, everybody! Please tell Joab to come close so I can talk to him.” When he had come, the woman said, “Are you Joab?”He said, “I am.”“Then,” she said, “listen to what I have to say.”He said, “I’m listening.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-19 </sup>“There’s an old saying in these parts: ‘If it’s answers you want, come to Abel and get it straight.’ We’re a peaceful people here, and reliable. And here you are, trying to tear down one of Israel’s mother cities. Why would you want to mess with <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s legacy like that?”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>Joab protested, “Believe me, you’ve got me all wrong. I’m not here to hurt anyone or destroy anything—not on your life! But a man from the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba son of Bicri by name, revolted against King David; hand him over, him only, and we’ll get out of here.”The woman told Joab, “Sounds good. His head will be tossed to you from the wall.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>The woman presented her strategy to the whole city and they did it: They cut off the head of Sheba son of Bicri and tossed it down to Joab. He then blew a blast on the ram’s horn trumpet and the soldiers all went home. Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-26 </sup>Joab was again commander of the whole army of Israel. Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; Adoniram over the work crews; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was clerk; Sheva was historian; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; Ira the Jairite was David’s chaplain."

(The Gibeonites were not part of Israel; they were what was left of the Amorites, and protected by a treaty with Israel. But Saul, a fanatic for the honor of Israel and Judah, tried to kill them off.)",

But the king selected Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons that Rizpah daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul, plus the five sons that Saul’s daughter Merab had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. He turned them over to the Gibeonites who hanged them on the mountain before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>—all seven died together. Harvest was just getting underway, the beginning of the barley harvest, when they were executed.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Rizpah daughter of Aiah took rough burlap and spread it out for herself on a rock from the beginning of the harvest until the heavy rains started. She kept the birds away from the bodies by day and the wild animals by night.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-14 </sup>David was told what she had done, this Rizpah daughter of Aiah and concubine of Saul. He then went and got the remains of Saul and Jonathan his son from the leaders at Jabesh Gilead (who had rescued them from the town square at Beth Shan where the Philistines had hung them after striking them down at Gilboa). He gathered up their remains and brought them together with the dead bodies of the seven who had just been hanged. The bodies were taken back to the land of Benjamin and given a decent burial in the tomb of Kish, Saul’s father.They did everything the king ordered to be done. That cleared things up: from then on God responded to Israel’s prayers for the land.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-17 </sup>War broke out again between the Philistines and Israel. David and his men went down to fight. David became exhausted. Ishbi-Benob, a warrior descended from Rapha, with a spear weighing nearly eight pounds and outfitted in brand-new armor, announced that he’d kill David. But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to the rescue, struck the Philistine, and killed him.Then David’s men swore to him, “No more fighting on the front-lines for you! Don’t snuff out the lamp of Israel!”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Later there was another skirmish with the Philistines at Gob. That time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, another of the warriors descended from Rapha.",

But David wouldn’t drink it; he poured it out as an offering to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, saying, “There is no way, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, that I’ll drink this! This isn’t mere water, it’s their life-blood—they risked their very lives to bring it!” So David refused to drink it.This is the sort of thing that the Three did.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-19 </sup>Abishai brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah was the head of the Thirty. He once got credit for killing three hundred with his spear, but he was never named in the same breath as the Three. He was the most respected of the Thirty and was their captain, but never got included among the Three.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>Benaiah son of Jehoiada from Kabzeel was a vigorous man who accomplished a great deal. He once killed two lion cubs in Moab. Another time, on a snowy day, he climbed down into a pit and killed a lion. Another time he killed a formidable Egyptian. The Egyptian was armed with a spear and Benaiah went against him with nothing but a walking stick; he seized the spear from his grip and killed him with his own spear.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>These are the things that Benaiah son of Jehoiada is famous for. But neither did he ever get ranked with the Three. He was held in greatest respect among the Thirty, but he never got included with the Three. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-39 </sup>“The Thirty” consisted of:Asahel brother of Joab;Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem;Shammah the Harodite;Elika the Harodite;Helez the Paltite;Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite;Abiezer the Anathothite;Sibbecai the Hushathite;Zalmon the Ahohite;Maharai the Netophathite;Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite;Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjaminites;Benaiah the Pirathonite;Hiddai from the badlands of Gaash;Abi-Albon the Arbathite;Azmaveth the Barhumite;Eliahba the Shaalbonite;Jashen the Gizonite;Jonathan son of Shammah the Hararite;Ahiam son of Sharar the Urite;Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite;Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite;Hezro the Carmelite;Paarai the Arbite;Igal son of Nathan, commander of the army of Hagrites;Zelek the Ammonite;Naharai the Beerothite, weapon bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah;Ira the Ithrite;Gareb the Ithrite;Uriah the Hittite.

			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">24 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Once again <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s anger blazed out against Israel. He tested David by telling him, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.” So David gave orders to Joab and the army officers under him, “Canvass all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and get a count of the population. I want to know the number.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>But Joab resisted the king: “May your <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> multiply people by the hundreds right before the eyes of my master the king, but why on earth would you do a thing like this?”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-9 </sup>Nevertheless, the king insisted, and so Joab and the army officers left the king to take a census of Israel. They crossed the Jordan and began with Aroer and the town in the canyon of the Gadites near Jazer, proceeded through Gilead, passed Hermon, then on to Dan, but detoured Sidon. They covered Fort Tyre and all the Hivite and Canaanite cities, and finally reached the Negev of Judah at Beersheba. They canvassed the whole country and after nine months and twenty days arrived back in Jerusalem. Joab gave the results of the census to the king: 800,000 able-bodied fighting men in Israel; in Judah 500,000.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But when it was all done, David was overwhelmed with guilt because he had counted the people, replacing trust with statistics. And David prayed to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, “I have sinned badly in what I have just done. But now <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> forgive my guilt—I’ve been really stupid.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>When David got up the next morning, the word of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had already come to Gad the prophet, David’s spiritual advisor, “Go and give David this message: ‘<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God </span>has spoken thus: There are three things I can do to you; choose one out of the three and I’ll see that it’s done.’”",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Gad came to deliver the message: “Do you want three years of famine in the land, or three months of running from your enemies while they chase you down, or three days of an epidemic on the country? Think it over and make up your mind. What shall I tell the one who sent me?”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>David told Gad, “They’re all terrible! But I’d rather be punished by <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, whose mercy is great, than fall into human hands.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>So <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> let loose an epidemic from morning until suppertime. From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand people died. But when the angel reached out over Jerusalem to destroy it, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> felt the pain of the terror and told the angel who was spreading death among the people, “Enough’s enough! Pull back!”The angel of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had just reached the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. David looked up and saw the angel hovering between earth and sky, sword drawn and about to strike Jerusalem. David and the elders bowed in prayer and covered themselves with rough burlap.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>When David saw the angel about to destroy the people, he prayed, “Please! I’m the one who sinned; I, the shepherd, did the wrong. But these sheep, what did they do wrong? Punish me and my family, not them.”",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-19 </sup>That same day Gad came to David and said, “Go and build an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” David did what Gad told him, what <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> commanded.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20-21 </sup>Araunah looked up and saw David and his men coming his way; he met them, bowing deeply, honoring the king and saying, “Why has my master the king come to see me?”“To buy your threshing floor,” said David, “so I can build an altar to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> here and put an end to this disaster.”",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>“Oh,” said Araunah, “let my master the king take and sacrifice whatever he wants. Look, here’s an ox for the burnt offering and threshing paddles and ox-yokes for fuel—Araunah gives it all to the king! And may <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, act in your favor.”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>But the king said to Araunah, “No. I’ve got to buy it from you for a good price; I’m not going to offer <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, my God, sacrifices that are no sacrifice.”So David bought the threshing floor and the ox, paying out fifty shekels of silver. He built an altar to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> there and sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> was moved by the prayers and that was the end of the disaster."
