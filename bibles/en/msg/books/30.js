He said:“Hit the tops of the shrine’s pillars,make the floor shake.The roof’s about to fall on the heads of the people,and whoever’s still alive, I’ll kill.No one will get away,no runaways will make it.If they dig their way down into the underworld,I’ll find them and bring them up.If they climb to the stars,I’ll find them and bring them down.If they hide out at the top of Mount Carmel,I’ll find them and bring them back.If they dive to the bottom of the ocean,I’ll send Dragon to swallow them up.If they’re captured alive by their enemies,I’ll send Sword to kill them.I’ve made up my mindto hurt them, not help them.”",

Didn’t I bring Israel up from Egypt, the Philistines from Caphtor, the Arameans from Qir? But you can be sure that I, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, the Master, have my eye on the Kingdom of Sin. I’m going to wipe it off the face of the earth. Still, I won’t totally destroy the family of Jacob.” <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Decree.",

I’ll repair the holes in the roof, replace the broken windows, fix it up like new. David’s people will be strong again and seize what’s left of enemy Edom, plus everyone else under my sovereign judgment.” <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s Decree.

You won’t be able to keep up. Everything will be happening at once—and everywhere you look, blessings! Blessings like wine pouring off the mountains and hills. I’ll make everything right again for my people Israel:“They’ll rebuild their ruined cities.They’ll plant vineyards and drink good wine.They’ll work their gardens and eat fresh vegetables.And I’ll plant <i>them,</i> plant them on their own land.They’ll never again be uprooted from the land I’ve given them.”<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, your God, says so."
