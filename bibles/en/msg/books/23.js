Angel-seraphs hovered above him, each with six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two their feet, and with two they flew. And they called back and forth one to the other,Holy, Holy, Holy is <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies.His bright glory fills the whole earth.The foundations trembled at the sound of the angel voices, and then the whole house filled with smoke.

He held a live coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. He touched my mouth with the coal and said,“Look. This coal has touched your lips.Gone your guilt,your sins wiped out.”And then I heard the voice of the Master:“Whom shall I send?Who will go for us?”I spoke up,“I’ll go.Send me!”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>He said, “Go and tell this people:“‘Listen hard, but you aren’t going to get it;look hard, but you won’t catch on.’Make these people blockheads,with fingers in their ears and blindfolds on their eyes,So they won’t see a thing,won’t hear a word,So they won’t have a clue about what’s going onand, yes, so they won’t turn around and be made whole.”",

When the Davidic government learned that Aram had joined forces with Ephraim (that is, Israel), Ahaz and his people were badly shaken. They shook like trees in the wind.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-6 </sup>Then <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> told Isaiah, “Go and meet Ahaz. Take your son Shear-jashub (A-Remnant-Will-Return) with you. Meet him south of the city at the end of the aqueduct where it empties into the upper pool on the road to the public laundry. Tell him, Listen, calm down. Don’t be afraid. And don’t panic over these two burnt-out cases, Rezin of Aram and the son of Remaliah. They talk big but there’s nothing to them. Aram, along with Ephraim’s son of Remaliah, have plotted to do you harm. They’ve conspired against you, saying, ‘Let’s go to war against Judah, dismember it, take it for ourselves, and set the son of Tabeel up as a puppet king over it.’",

It’s bad enough that you make people tired with your pious, timid hypocrisies, but now you’re making God tired. So the Master is going to give you a sign anyway. Watch for this: A girl who is presently a virgin will get pregnant. She’ll bear a son and name him Immanuel (God-With-Us). By the time the child is twelve years old, able to make moral decisions, the threat of war will be over. Relax, those two kings that have you so worried will be out of the picture. But also be warned: <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> will bring on you and your people and your government a judgment worse than anything since the time the kingdom split, when Ephraim left Judah.

			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-22 </sup>It will be a time when survivors will count themselves lucky to have a cow and a couple of sheep. At least they’ll have plenty of milk! Whoever’s left in the land will learn to make do with the simplest foods—curds, whey, and honey.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23-25 </sup>But that’s not the end of it. This country that used to be covered with fine vineyards—thousands of them, worth millions!—will revert to a weed patch.
