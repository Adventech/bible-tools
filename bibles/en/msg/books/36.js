The god Money is dead.On Judgment Day,I’ll search through every closet and alley in Jerusalem.I’ll find and punish those who are sitting it out, fat and lazy,amusing themselves and taking it easy,Who think, ‘<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> doesn’t do anything, good or bad.He isn’t involved, so neither are we.’But just wait. They’ll lose everything they have,money and house and land.They’ll build a house and never move in.They’ll plant vineyards and never taste the wine.",
