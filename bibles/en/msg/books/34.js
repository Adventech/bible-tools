			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2-6 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is serious business.He won’t be trifled with.He avenges his foes.He stands up against his enemies, fierce and raging.But <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> doesn’t lose his temper.He’s powerful, but it’s a patient power.Still, no one gets by with anything.Sooner or later, everyone pays.Tornadoes and hurricanesare the wake of his passage,Storm clouds are the dusthe shakes off his feet.He yells at the sea: It dries up.All the rivers run dry.The Bashan and Carmel mountains shrivel,the Lebanon orchards shrivel.Mountains quake in their roots,hills dissolve into mud flats.Earth shakes in fear of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>.The whole world’s in a panic.Who can face such towering anger?Who can stand up to this fierce rage?His anger spills out like a river of lava,his fury shatters boulders.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-10 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is good,a hiding place in tough times.He recognizes and welcomesanyone looking for help,No matter how desperate the trouble.But cozy islands of escapeHe wipes right off the map.No one gets away from God.Why waste time conniving against <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>?He’s putting an end to all such scheming.For troublemakers, no second chances.Like a pile of dry brush,Soaked in oil,they’ll go up in flames.",

It’s an unmarked grave.You’re nothing—no, you’re <i>less</i> than nothing!”",

Do something!”but it’s too late. Nineveh’s soon empty—nothing.Other cries come: “Plunder the silver!Plunder the gold!A bonanza of plunder!Take everything you want!”Doom! Damnation! Desolation!Hearts sink,knees fold,stomachs retch,faces blanch.So, what happened to the famousand fierce Assyrian lionAnd all those cute Assyrian cubs?To the lion and lionessCozy with their cubs,fierce and fearless?To the lion who always returned from the huntwith fresh kills for lioness and cubs,The lion lair heaped with bloody meat,blood and bones for the royal lion feast?",
