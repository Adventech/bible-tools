			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>After Ahab died, Moab rebelled against Israel.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>One day Ahaziah fell through the balcony railing on the rooftop of his house in Samaria and was injured. He sent messengers off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, “Am I going to recover from this accident?”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s angel spoke to Elijah the Tishbite: “Up on your feet! Go out and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria with this word, ‘Is it because there’s no God in Israel that you’re running off to consult Baal-Zebub god of Ekron?’ Here’s a message from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> you’ve tried to bypass: ‘You’re not going to get out of that bed you’re in—you’re as good as dead already.’” Elijah delivered the message and was gone.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The messengers went back. The king said, “So why are you back so soon—what’s going on?”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>They told him, “A man met us and said, ‘Turn around and go back to the king who sent you; tell him, <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s message: Is it because there’s no God in Israel that you’re running off to consult Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? You needn’t bother. You’re not going to get out of that bed you’re in—you’re as good as dead already.’”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The king said, “Tell me more about this man who met you and said these things to you. What was he like?”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>“Shaggy,” they said, “and wearing a leather belt.”He said, “That has to be Elijah the Tishbite!”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>The king sent a captain with fifty men to Elijah. Meanwhile Elijah was sitting, big as life, on top of a hill. The captain said, “O Holy Man! King’s orders: Come down!”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Elijah answered the captain of the fifty, “If it’s true that I’m a ‘holy man,’ lightning strike you and your fifty men!” Out of the blue lightning struck and incinerated the captain and his fifty.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The king sent another captain with his fifty men, “O Holy Man! King’s orders: Come down. And right now!”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Elijah answered, “If it’s true that I’m a ‘holy man,’ lightning strike you and your fifty men!” Immediately a divine lightning bolt struck and incinerated the captain and his fifty.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-14 </sup>The king then sent a third captain with his fifty men. For a third time, a captain with his fifty approached Elijah. This one fell on his knees in supplication: “O Holy Man, have respect for my life and the souls of these fifty men! Twice now lightning from out of the blue has struck and incinerated captains with their fifty men; please, I beg you, respect my life!”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The angel of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> told Elijah, “Go ahead; and don’t be afraid.” Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Elijah told him, “<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s word: Because you sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub the god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel to whom you could pray, you’ll never get out of that bed alive—already you’re as good as dead.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And he died, exactly as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s word spoken by Elijah had said.Because Ahaziah had no son, his brother Joram became the next king. The succession took place in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>The rest of Ahaziah’s life is recorded in <i>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</i>."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-2 </sup>Just before <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> took Elijah to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on a walk out of Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has sent me on an errand to Bethel.”Elisha said, “Not on your life! I’m not letting you out of my sight!” So they both went to Bethel.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The guild of prophets at Bethel met Elisha and said, “Did you know that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is going to take your master away from you today?”“Yes,” he said, “I know it. But keep it quiet.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has sent me on an errand to Jericho.”Elisha said, “Not on your life! I’m not letting you out of my sight!” So they both went to Jericho.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The guild of prophets at Jericho came to Elisha and said, “Did you know that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> is going to take your master away from you today?”“Yes,” he said, “I know it. But keep it quiet.”",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Then Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has sent me on an errand to the Jordan.”Elisha said, “Not on your life! I’m not letting you out of my sight!” And so the two of them went their way together.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Meanwhile, fifty men from the guild of prophets gathered some distance away while the two of them stood at the Jordan.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and hit the water with it. The river divided and the two men walked through on dry land.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>When they reached the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, “What can I do for you before I’m taken from you? Ask anything.”Elisha said, “Your life repeated in my life. I want to be a holy man just like you.”",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“That’s a hard one!” said Elijah. “But if you’re watching when I’m taken from you, you’ll get what you’ve asked for. But only if you’re watching.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-14 </sup>And so it happened. They were walking along and talking. Suddenly a chariot and horses of fire came between them and Elijah went up in a whirlwind to heaven. Elisha saw it all and shouted, “My father, my father! You—the chariot and cavalry of Israel!” When he could no longer see anything, he grabbed his robe and ripped it to pieces. Then he picked up Elijah’s cloak that had fallen from him, returned to the shore of the Jordan, and stood there. He took Elijah’s cloak—all that was left of Elijah!—and hit the river with it, saying, “Now where is the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> of Elijah? Where is he?”When he struck the water, the river divided and Elisha walked through.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The guild of prophets from Jericho saw the whole thing from where they were standing. They said, “The spirit of Elijah lives in Elisha!” They welcomed and honored him.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>They then said, “We’re at your service. We have fifty reliable men here; let’s send them out to look for your master. Maybe <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s spirit has swept him off to some mountain or dropped him into a remote ravine.”Elisha said, “No. Don’t send them.”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>But they pestered him until he caved in: “Go ahead then. Send them.”So they sent the fifty men off. For three days they looked, searching high and low. Nothing.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Finally, they returned to Elisha in Jericho. He told them, “So there—didn’t I tell you?”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>One day the men of the city said to Elisha, “You can see for yourself, master, how well our city is located. But the water is polluted and nothing grows.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>He said, “Bring me a brand-new bowl and put some salt in it.” They brought it to him.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-22 </sup>He then went to the spring, sprinkled the salt into it, and proclaimed, “<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s word: I’ve healed this water. It will no longer kill you or poison your land.” And sure enough, the water was healed—and remains so to this day, just as Elisha said.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Another time, Elisha was on his way to Bethel and some little kids came out from the town and taunted him, “What’s up, old baldhead! Out of our way, skinhead!”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Elisha turned, took one look at them, and cursed them in the name of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. Two bears charged out of the underbrush and knocked them about, ripping them limb from limb—forty-two children in all!",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Elisha went on to Mount Carmel, and then returned to Samaria."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>Joram son of Ahab began his rule over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. He was king for twelve years. In <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s sight he was a bad king. But he wasn’t as bad as his father and mother—to his credit he destroyed the obscene Baal stone that his father had made. But he hung on to the sinful practices of Jeroboam son of Nebat, the ones that had corrupted Israel for so long. He wasn’t about to give them up.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4-7 </sup>King Mesha of Moab raised sheep. He was forced to give the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and another 100,000 rams. When Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. So King Joram set out from Samaria and prepared Israel for war. His first move was to send a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Would you join me and fight him?”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7-8 </sup>“I’m with you all the way,” said Jehoshaphat. “My troops are your troops, my horses are your horses. Which route shall we take?”“Through the badlands of Edom.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>The king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom started out on what proved to be a looping detour. After seven days they had run out of water for both army and animals.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The king of Israel said, “Bad news! <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> has gotten us three kings out here to dump us into the hand of Moab.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> anywhere around through whom we can consult <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>?”One of the servants of the king of Israel said, “Elisha son of Shaphat is around somewhere—the one who was Elijah’s right-hand man.”",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Jehoshaphat said, “Good! A man we can trust!” So the three of them—the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom—went to meet him.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Elisha addressed the king of Israel, “What do you and I have in common? Go consult the puppet-prophets of your father and mother.”“Never!” said the king of Israel. “It’s <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> who has gotten us into this fix, dumping all three of us kings into the hand of Moab.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14-15 </sup>Elisha said, “As <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies lives, and before whom I stand ready to serve, if it weren’t for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I wouldn’t give you the time of day. But considering—bring me a minstrel.” (When a minstrel played, the power of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> came on Elisha.)",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-19 </sup>He then said, “<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s word: Dig ditches all over this valley. Here’s what will happen—you won’t hear the wind, you won’t see the rain, but this valley is going to fill up with water and your army and your animals will drink their fill. This is easy for <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> to do; he will also hand over Moab to you. You will ravage the country: Knock out its fortifications, level the key villages, clear-cut the orchards, clog the springs, and litter the cultivated fields with stones.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>In the morning—it was at the hour of morning sacrifice—the water had arrived, water pouring in from the west, from Edom, a flash flood filling the valley with water.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21-22 </sup>By this time everyone in Moab had heard that the kings had come up to make war against them. Everyone who was able to handle a sword was called into service and took a stand at the border. They were up and ready early in the morning when the sun rose over the water. From where the Moabites stood, the water reflecting the sun looked red, like blood.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>“Blood! Look at the blood!” they said. “The kings must have fought each other—a bloody massacre! Go for the loot, Moab!”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>When Moab entered the camp of Israel, the Israelites were up on their feet killing Moabites right and left, the Moabites running for their lives, Israelites relentless in pursuit—a slaughter. They leveled the towns, littered the cultivated fields with rocks, clogged the springs, and clear-cut the orchards. Only the capital, Kir Hareseth, was left intact, and that not for long; it too was surrounded and attacked with thrown and flung rocks.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26-27 </sup>When the king of Moab realized that he was fighting a losing battle, he took seven hundred swordsmen to hack a corridor past the king of Edom, but they didn’t make it. Then he took his son, his firstborn who would succeed him as king, and sacrificed him on the city wall. That set off furious anger against Israel. Israel pulled back and returned home."

		"4": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">4 </span>One day the wife of a man from the guild of prophets called out to Elisha, “Your servant my husband is dead. You well know what a good man he was, devoted to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. And now the man to whom he was in debt is on his way to collect by taking my two children as slaves.”",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Elisha said, “I wonder how I can be of help. Tell me, what do you have in your house?”“Nothing,” she said. “Well, I do have a little oil.”",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3-4 </sup>“Here’s what you do,” said Elisha. “Go up and down the street and borrow jugs and bowls from all your neighbors. And not just a few—all you can get. Then come home and lock the door behind you, you and your sons. Pour oil into each container; when each is full, set it aside.”",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5-6 </sup>She did what he said. She locked the door behind her and her sons; as they brought the containers to her, she filled them. When all the jugs and bowls were full, she said to one of her sons, “Another jug, please.”He said, “That’s it. There are no more jugs.”Then the oil stopped.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>She went and told the story to the man of God. He said, “Go sell the oil and make good on your debts. Live, both you and your sons, on what’s left.”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>One day Elisha passed through Shunem. A leading lady of the town talked him into stopping for a meal. And then it became his custom: Whenever he passed through, he stopped by for a meal.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9-10 </sup>“I’m certain,” said the woman to her husband, “that this man who stops by with us all the time is a holy man of God. Why don’t we add on a small room upstairs and furnish it with a bed and desk, chair and lamp, so that when he comes by he can stay with us?”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And so it happened that the next time Elisha came by he went to the room and lay down for a nap.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Then he said to his servant Gehazi, “Tell the Shunammite woman I want to see her.” He called her and she came to him.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Through Gehazi Elisha said, “You’ve gone far beyond the call of duty in taking care of us; what can we do for you? Do you have a request we can bring to the king or to the commander of the army?”She replied, “Nothing. I’m secure and satisfied in my family.”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Elisha conferred with Gehazi: “There’s got to be something we can do for her. But what?”Gehazi said, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is an old man.”",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>“Call her in,” said Elisha. He called her and she stood at the open door.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Elisha said to her, “This time next year you’re going to be nursing an infant son.”“O my master, O Holy Man,” she said, “don’t play games with me, teasing me with such fantasies!”",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The woman conceived. A year later, just as Elisha had said, she had a son.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-19 </sup>The child grew up. One day he went to his father, who was working with the harvest hands, complaining, “My head, my head!”His father ordered a servant, “Carry him to his mother.”",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The servant took him in his arms and carried him to his mother. He lay on her lap until noon and died.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>She took him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut him in alone, and left.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>She then called her husband, “Get me a servant and a donkey so I can go to the Holy Man; I’ll be back as soon as I can.”",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>“But why today? This isn’t a holy day—it’s neither New Moon nor Sabbath.”She said, “Don’t ask questions; I need to go right now. Trust me.”",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24-25 </sup>She went ahead and saddled the donkey, ordering her servant, “Take the lead—and go as fast as you can; I’ll tell you if you’re going too fast.” And so off she went. She came to the Holy Man at Mount Carmel.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25-26 </sup>The Holy Man, spotting her while she was still a long way off, said to his servant Gehazi, “Look out there; why, it’s the Shunammite woman! Quickly now. Ask her, ‘Is something wrong? Are you all right? Your husband? Your child?’”She said, “Everything’s fine.”",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>But when she reached the Holy Man at the mountain, she threw herself at his feet and held tightly to him.Gehazi came up to pull her away, but the Holy Man said, “Leave her alone—can’t you see that she’s in distress? But <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> hasn’t let me in on why; I’m completely in the dark.”",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Then she spoke up: “Did I ask for a son, master? Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t tease me with false hopes’?”",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>He ordered Gehazi, “Don’t lose a minute—grab my staff and run as fast as you can. If you meet anyone, don’t even take time to greet him, and if anyone greets you, don’t even answer. Lay my staff across the boy’s face.”",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>The boy’s mother said, “As sure as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> lives and you live, you’re not leaving me behind.” And so Gehazi let her take the lead, and followed behind.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>But Gehazi arrived first and laid the staff across the boy’s face. But there was no sound—no sign of life. Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and said, “The boy hasn’t stirred.”",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32-35 </sup>Elisha entered the house and found the boy stretched out on the bed dead. He went into the room and locked the door—just the two of them in the room—and prayed to <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. He then got into bed with the boy and covered him with his body, mouth on mouth, eyes on eyes, hands on hands. As he was stretched out over him like that, the boy’s body became warm. Elisha got up and paced back and forth in the room. Then he went back and stretched himself upon the boy again. The boy started sneezing—seven times he sneezed!—and opened his eyes.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>He called Gehazi and said, “Get the Shunammite woman in here!” He called her and she came in.Elisha said, “Embrace your son!”",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>She fell at Elisha’s feet, face to the ground in reverent awe. Then she embraced her son and went out with him.",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Elisha went back down to Gilgal. There was a famine there. While he was consulting with the guild of prophets, he told his servant, “Put a large pot on the fire and cook up some stew for the prophets.”",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39-40 </sup>One of the men went out into the field to get some herbs; he came across a wild vine and picked gourds from it, filling his gunnysack. He brought them back, sliced them up, and put them in the stew, even though no one knew what kind of plant it was. The stew was then served up for the men to eat. They started to eat, and then exclaimed, “Death in the pot, O man of God! Death in the pot!” Nobody could eat it.Elisha ordered, “Get me some meal.” Then he sprinkled it into the stew pot.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>“Now serve it up to the men,” he said. They ate it, and it was just fine—nothing wrong with <i>that</i> stew!",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>One day a man arrived from Baal Shalishah. He brought the man of God twenty loaves of fresh-baked bread from the early harvest, along with a few apples from the orchard.Elisha said, “Pass it around to the people to eat.”",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>His servant said, “For a hundred men? There’s not nearly enough!”Elisha said, “Just go ahead and do it. <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> says there’s plenty.”",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>And sure enough, there was. He passed around what he had—they not only ate, but had leftovers."
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">5 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-3 </sup>Naaman was general of the army under the king of Aram. He was important to his master, who held him in the highest esteem because it was by him that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had given victory to Aram: a truly great man, but afflicted with a grievous skin disease. It so happened that Aram, on one of its raiding expeditions against Israel, captured a young girl who became a maid to Naaman’s wife. One day she said to her mistress, “Oh, if only my master could meet the prophet of Samaria, he would be healed of his skin disease.”",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Naaman went straight to his master and reported what the girl from Israel had said.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>“Well then, go,” said the king of Aram. “And I’ll send a letter of introduction to the king of Israel.”So he went off, taking with him about 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and ten sets of clothes.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Naaman delivered the letter to the king of Israel. The letter read, “When you get this letter, you’ll know that I’ve personally sent my servant Naaman to you; heal him of his skin disease.”",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>When the king of Israel read the letter, he was terribly upset, ripping his robe to pieces. He said, “Am I a god with the power to bring death or life that I get orders to heal this man from his disease? What’s going on here? That king’s trying to pick a fight, that’s what!”",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Elisha the man of God heard what had happened, that the king of Israel was so distressed that he’d ripped his robe to shreds. He sent word to the king, “Why are you so upset, ripping your robe like this? Send him to me so he’ll learn that there’s a prophet in Israel.”",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>So Naaman with his horses and chariots arrived in style and stopped at Elisha’s door.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Elisha sent out a servant to meet him with this message: “Go to the River Jordan and immerse yourself seven times. Your skin will be healed and you’ll be as good as new.”",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11-12 </sup>Naaman lost his temper. He turned on his heel saying, “I thought he’d personally come out and meet me, call on the name of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>, wave his hand over the diseased spot, and get rid of the disease. The Damascus rivers, Abana and Pharpar, are cleaner by far than any of the rivers in Israel. Why not bathe in them? I’d at least get clean.” He stomped off, mad as a hornet.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But his servants caught up with him and said, “Father, if the prophet had asked you to do something hard and heroic, wouldn’t you have done it? So why not this simple ‘wash and be clean’?”",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>So he did it. He went down and immersed himself in the Jordan seven times, following the orders of the Holy Man. His skin was healed; it was like the skin of a little baby. He was as good as new.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>He then went back to the Holy Man, he and his entourage, stood before him, and said, “I now know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no God anywhere on earth other than the God of Israel. In gratitude let me give you a gift.”",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>“As <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> lives,” Elisha replied, “the God whom I serve, I’ll take nothing from you.” Naaman tried his best to get him to take something, but he wouldn’t do it.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17-18 </sup>“If you won’t take anything,” said Naaman, “let me ask you for something: Give me a load of dirt, as much as a team of donkeys can carry, because I’m never again going to worship any god other than <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. But there’s one thing for which I need <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s pardon: When my master, leaning on my arm, enters the shrine of Rimmon and worships there, and I’m with him there, worshiping Rimmon, may you see to it that <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> forgive me for this.”",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19-21 </sup>Elisha said, “Everything will be all right.

If they receive us we’ll live, if they kill us we’ll die. We’ve got nothing to lose.”",

The Master had made the army of Aram hear the sound of horses and a mighty army on the march. They told one another, “The king of Israel hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to attack us!” Panicked, they ran for their lives through the darkness, abandoning tents, horses, donkeys—the whole camp just as it was—running for dear life. These four lepers entered the camp and went into a tent. First they ate and drank. Then they grabbed silver, gold, and clothing, and went off and hid it. They came back, entered another tent, and looted it, again hiding their plunder.",

			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The king ordered his attendant, the one he leaned on for support, to be in charge of the city gate. The people, turned into a mob, poured through the gate, trampling him to death. It was exactly what the Holy Man had said when the king had come to see him.",

Trapdoors opening in the sky and food tumbling out?” followed by the response, “You’ll watch it with your own eyes, but you won’t eat so much as a mouthful”—proved true.

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The threat from Egypt was now over—no more invasions by the king of Egypt—for by this time the king of Babylon had captured all the land between the Brook of Egypt and the Euphrates River, land formerly controlled by the king of Egypt.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-9 </sup>Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king. His rule in Jerusalem lasted only three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem. In <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s opinion he also was an evil king, no different from his father.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10-12 </sup>The next thing to happen was that the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Jerusalem and put it under siege. While his officers were laying siege to the city, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon paid a personal visit. And Jehoiachin king of Judah, along with his mother, officers, advisors, and government leaders, surrendered.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12-14 </sup>In the eighth year of his reign Jehoiachin was taken prisoner by the king of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar emptied the treasuries of both The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> and the royal palace and confiscated all the gold furnishings that Solomon king of Israel had made for The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>. This should have been no surprise—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> had said it would happen. And then he emptied Jerusalem of people—all its leaders and soldiers, all its craftsmen and artisans. He took them into exile, something like ten thousand of them! The only ones he left were the very poor.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15-16 </sup>He took Jehoiachin into exile to Babylon. With him he took the king’s mother, his wives, his chief officers, the community leaders, anyone who was anybody—in round numbers, seven thousand soldiers plus another thousand or so craftsmen and artisans, all herded off into exile in Babylon.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Then the king of Babylon made Jehoiachin’s uncle, Mattaniah, his puppet king, but changed his name to Zedekiah.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he started out as king. He was king in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah. Her hometown was Libnah.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>As far as <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> was concerned Zedekiah was just one more evil king, a carbon copy of Jehoiakim.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The source of all this doom to Jerusalem and Judah was <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span>’s anger—<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> turned his back on them as an act of judgment. And then Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon."

		"25": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">25 </span><sup class=\"versenum\">1-7 </sup>The revolt dates from the ninth year and tenth month of Zedekiah’s reign. Nebuchadnezzar set out for Jerusalem immediately with a full army. He set up camp and sealed off the city by building siege mounds around it. The city was under siege for nineteen months (until the eleventh year of Zedekiah). By the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was so bad that there wasn’t so much as a crumb of bread for anyone. Then there was a breakthrough. At night, under cover of darkness, the entire army escaped through an opening in the wall (it was the gate between the two walls above the King’s Garden). They slipped through the lines of the Babylonians who surrounded the city and headed for the Jordan on the Arabah Valley road. But the Babylonians were in pursuit of the king and they caught up with him in the Plains of Jericho. By then Zedekiah’s army had deserted and was scattered. The Babylonians took Zedekiah prisoner and marched him off to the king of Babylon at Riblah, then tried and sentenced him on the spot. Zedekiah’s sons were executed right before his eyes; the summary murder of his sons was the last thing he saw, for they then blinded him. Securely handcuffed, he was hauled off to Babylon.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8-12 </sup>In the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, on the seventh day of the fifth month, Nebuzaradan, the king of Babylon’s chief deputy, arrived in Jerusalem. He burned The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> to the ground, went on to the royal palace, and then finished off the city—burned the whole place down. He put the Babylonian troops he had with him to work knocking down the city walls. Finally, he rounded up everyone left in the city, including those who had earlier deserted to the king of Babylon, and took them off into exile. He left a few poor dirt farmers behind to tend the vineyards and what was left of the fields.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13-15 </sup>The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the bronze washstands, and the huge bronze basin (the Sea) that were in The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> and hauled the bronze off to Babylon. They also took the various bronze-crafted liturgical accessories used in the services of Temple worship, as well as the gold and silver censers and sprinkling bowls. The king’s deputy didn’t miss a thing—he took every scrap of precious metal he could find.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16-17 </sup>The amount of bronze they got from the two pillars, the Sea, and all the washstands that Solomon had made for The Temple of <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">God</span> was enormous—they couldn’t weigh it all! Each pillar stood twenty-seven feet high, plus another four and a half feet for an ornate capital of bronze filigree and decorative fruit.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18-21 </sup>The king’s deputy took a number of special prisoners: Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the associate priest, three wardens, the chief remaining army officer, five of the king’s counselors, the accountant, the chief recruiting officer for the army, and sixty men of standing from among the people. Nebuzaradan the king’s deputy marched them all off to the king of Babylon at Riblah. And there at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon killed the lot of them in cold blood.Judah went into exile, orphaned from her land.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22-23 </sup>Regarding the common people who were left behind in Judah, this: Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as their governor. When veteran army officers among the people heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. Among them were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, and some of their followers.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Gedaliah assured the officers and their men, giving them his word, “Don’t be afraid of the Babylonian officials. Go back to your farms and families and respect the king of Babylon. Trust me, everything is going to be all right.”",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Some time later—it was in the seventh month—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama (he had royal blood in him), came back with ten men and killed Gedaliah, the traitor Jews, and the Babylonian officials who were stationed at Mizpah—a bloody massacre.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>But then, afraid of what the Babylonians would do, they all took off for Egypt, leaders and people, small and great.",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27-30 </sup>When Jehoiachin king of Judah had been in exile for thirty-seven years, Evil-Merodach became king in Babylon and let Jehoiachin out of prison. This release took place on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month. The king treated him most courteously and gave him preferential treatment beyond anything experienced by the other political prisoners held in Babylon. Jehoiachin took off his prison garb and for the rest of his life ate his meals in company with the king. The king provided everything he needed to live comfortably."
